        "question": "The names of the *Shisha Sidrei Mishna* (Six Orders of Mishnah) are: Zeraim, Moed, Nashim, Nezikim, Kodshim, Taharos. All of them besides Moed are in plural form. However Moed is in singular form. Why is it not called Seder Moadim (similar to the expression *moadim l'simcha*)?",
        "answer": "From [Soncino's intro](http://halakhah.com/talmud/moed.html) to Seder Moed:\n\n\"It might be observed that the designation 'Mo'ed' is in the singular, as distinct from the plural forms used to designate the other Orders, e.g., Nashim, Nezikin, etc. It has been suggested that the singular is here specially used to avoid the confusion that might arise through the employment of the plural Seder Mo'adim (or Mo'adoth) denoting as it does in Rabbinic literature the Order of the Calendar1. The opinion may, however, be hazarded that it is because the Sabbath and the festivals constitute one complete cycle of Jewish observance that preference has been given to the singular form.\"\n\n1.

        "question": "Eilenberg and Moore have shown that given a monad $L$, if $L$ has right adjoint $R$, then $R$ is a comonad.\n\nI see how to dualize this result to obtain the following theorem: given a comonad $R$, if $R$ has left adjoint $L$, then $L$ is a monad. Indeed it suffices to notice that an adjunction $L \\dashv R$ dualizes to $R^\\text{op} \\dashv L^\\text{op}$.\n\nBut at the bottom of [page 7 of this paper](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dao7/drafts/monad-or-comonad-orchard11-draft.pdf#page=7), it is written that it also \"*easily*\" dualizes to the following theorem: given a comonad $L$, if $L$ has right adjoint $R$, then $R$ is a monad. How to make this easy dualization?",
        "answer": "Let $\\mathcal K$ be a $2$-category. A monad in $\\mathcal K$ is an object $C$ together with a $1$-morphism $T \\colon C \\to C$ and $2$-morphisms $\\eta \\colon 1 \\to T$ and $\\mu \\colon TT \\to T$ as well as some commuting diagrams (see [the nlab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/monad#monads)). Comonads can be similarly defined.\n\nSimilarly, adjunctions can be defined internally to any $2$-category. A right adjoint to a $1$-morphism $L \\colon C \\to D$ is a $1$-morphism $R \\colon D \\to C$ with a unit and counit making the usual diagrams commute (modulo coherence isomorphisms).\n\nGiven that a monad structure on $L$ yields a comonad structure on any right adjoint $R$, we can get all four possible dualizations by switching out $\\mathcal K$ for its duals.\n\nYou can check that a monad structure on $T$ in $\\mathcal K^{co}$ ($2$-morphisms are reversed) is the same as a comonad structure on $T$ in $\\mathcal K$. This also dualizes adjoints: if $L \\dashv R$ in $\\mathcal K^{co}$ then $R \\dashv L$ in $\\mathcal K$.\n\nInterestingly, switching to $\\mathcal K^{op}$ only dualizes adjoints: if $L \\dashv R$ in $\\mathcal K^{op}$ ($1$-morphisms are reversed), then $R \\dashv L$ in $\\mathcal K$.\n\nTo dualize only monads, we can use $\\mathcal K^{coop}$ (both kinds of arrows are reversed).\n\n---\n\nSome more details, as requested. Suppose we're given an ordinary comonad $L$ and $L$ has an ordinary right adjoint $R$. We'd like to conclude that $R$ is a monad by applying the theorem that given a monad $L$ and a right adjoint $R$, $R$ is a comonad.\n\nMore specifically, we're going to apply the *general $2$-category* version of that theorem. We need to start with a monad, but right now we have a comonad. To switch between them, we'll work with $\\mathcal {Cat}^{co}$ instead. This means that we have a comonad now, but also switches the adjunctions, so that our comonad has a left adjoint. (Doing just this step is equivalent to switching out the category for its opposite, i.e. the trivial duality).\n\nThus, we need to dualize again in a way that unswaps adjoints, but leaves monads unchanged. Taking the $^{op}$ of the $2$-category accomplishes that, so now we're working in $\\mathcal {Cat}^{coop}$.\n\nTo spell that out explicitly, if we're given an ordinary comonad $L$ and an ordinary right adjoint $R$, then this same data is equivalently a monad $L$ and a right adjoint $R$ in $\\mathcal {Cat}^{coop}$. Then applying the general theorem, we get a comonad structure on $R$ in $\\mathcal {Cat}^{coop}$, which translates back to a monad structure on $R$ in in $\\mathcal {Cat}$, i.e., an ordinary monad.",

Use IE's `filter` style. I hesitate to recommend this, as there are issues with it that you may have to work around, but it is an option. (the main issue I predict is in IE9 which will try to support the `filter` *and* the modern CSS feature, resulting in a clash)\n\n`filter` has an `opactity` feature, but that's not a direct equivalent for RGBa. If you want an actual feature match using `filter`, you'll need to do it as a filter gradient (albeit a gradient with no colour changes), since that will allow you to include the alpha layer in the colours. See various places on the web for how to do CSS gradients in IE<=8.\n2. Use a polyfill script like [CSS3Pie](http://www.css3pie.com/). This will give you pretty seamless support for RGBa background colours in IE8 and earlier. As long as you're happy to have a Javascript library doing the hard work, this is definitely the best option.\n3. Use a PNG image with the appropriate transparency for the background instead of a background colour. The simple and obvious solution. Kinda old-fashioned, and a bit of a shame to throw away the nice shiny CSS RGBa feature just because an obsolete browser doesn't support it, but you can be fairly certain it'll work, doesn't require and JS or hacks, and won't have any unexpected side-effects.\n4. Just give up with trying to support IE8 with this particular thing. Is the transparency really vital to your site or does it just make it look better. Would an IE8 user really notice the difference if you just gave him a solid non-transparent colour? These, of course, are questions that only you can answer about your specific site. If you need it, then you need it and you'll have to use one of the other options, but if you can get away without it for your IE8 users then maybe that's the solution. (it might even help encourage people to upgrade their browsers)",

While a general translation would be \u2018I have a crush on you\u2019, that does not convey the physical aspect which is rather important in my opinion. Even if I was madly in love with (only) the character of a person, I would not use it if I didn\u2019t also find their body at least somewhat attractive. On the other hand, it can also be used in contexts such as \u2018Ich steh zwar auf dein Aussehen, aber menschlich bist du ein Arsch.\u2019 (I like you\u2019re looks but you\u2019re an arse.)",

        "question": "Two prominent mathematicians who were disabled in ways which would have made it difficult to work were Lev Pontryagin and Solomon Lefschetz. \n\nPontryagin was blind as a result of a stove explosion at the age of $14$, though he learned mathematics because his mother read him math papers and books, and he went on to contribute to algebraic topology, differential topology, and optimal control in significant ways. Several results now bear his name, including Pontryagin's Maximum Principle in optimal control which was a landmark theoretical development in the field.\n\nSolomon Lefschetz lost both of his hands in an electrical transformer fire in his twenties. This accident pushed him towards mathematics and he went on make contributions to algebraic geometry, topology, and nonlinear differential equations. The Picard-Lefschetz formula and the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem are named after him, and his work in nonlinear differential equations helped interest in the field to grow, particularly in the United States. \n\nThere are surely other similar examples in the history of mathematics that I don't know about. Accordingly, my question is:\n\n> \n> Who are some mathematicians that have made important contributions to mathematics despite their ability to work being hampered by a disability?\n> \n> \n> \n\nAn answer to this question should, naturally, contain the name of the mathematician and the way in which their ability to work was impaired. It should also contain a (possibly brief) description of their contributions, with mention of specific results where relevant.",
        "answer": "[Joseph Plateau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Plateau) should be mentioned. While Wikipedia classifies him as a physicist, this was back when there was much less distinction between physicist and mathematician. He more or less invented the \"moving image\", and was obsessed with light and the eye. He used to stare at the sun or other bright lights to try to understand the retinal fatigue experienced afterwards. Perhaps because of this, he went blind later in life.\n\nWith worsening vision, he went to other aspects of physics. The most interesting in my opinion is the semi-understood phenomenon now called \"Plateau's Rotating Drop.\" If you suspend a viscous liquid in another liquid of the same density, and rotate the suspended drop at the right acceleration, then it will deform from a sphere to an ellipsoid to **a torus**. [Here](http://www.ace.gatech.edu/experiments2/plateau/plateau.html) are some pictures from my old lab (my first research experience!) on this experiment.\n\nIt's said that he would rotate drops for hours, making his son describe exactly what was happening.\n\nPlateau also worked a lot with capillary action and soap bubbles - a differential geometer before his time.",

        "answer": "I understand your point about using safe mode. If you try to use UPDATE or DELETE against a non-indexed expression, it complains, because it can't make an estimate of whether you will accidentally delete your whole table.\n\nUsing an expression on `DATE(dateHeureModification) > ...`\n is naturally unindexed. MySQL can't do an index lookup against the result of a function.\n\nYou can use `LIMIT` in your delete query to make it satisfy the safe-updates mode. MySQL treats it as sufficient protection against accidentally deleting all the rows in the table, if you use `LIMIT`.\n\n```\nDELETE\n    FROM SYS_VERROUS_POLICE\n    WHERE DATE(dateHeureModification) < (curdate() - INTERVAL 14 DAY)\n    LIMIT 1000;\n\n```\n\nIt's a good idea to run the delete in limited-size batches anyway, so it doesn't create too many locks or add too much to the undo segment. \n\nJust keep doing DELETE in a loop, deleting batches of 1000 rows at a time, and check **rows-affected** after each batch. Stop the loop when rows-affected reaches 0.\n\nAnother idea: I don't think you really need the `DATE()` function in your WHERE clause. So you might be able to do the DELETE like below, and it will be able to use an index. Besides, it should be faster to the query to check for any rows if you have an index on dateHeureModification.\n\n```\nDELETE\n    FROM SYS_VERROUS_POLICE\n    WHERE dateHeureModification < (curdate() - INTERVAL 14 DAY)\n    LIMIT 1000;\n\n```",

Typically a photographer wants to use something around 85mm-100mm (on a full frame sensor) for a nice sharp portrait. Since your camera is APS-C and probably multiplies the focal length by 1.6x, you're looking at about an 80mm equivalent from your 50mm lens which gets you close enough to the sweet spot for portraits. Also the Canon 50mm f/1.8 is way sharper than either of the other two lenses that you mentioned. \n\nSummary: Unless you're using a 5D or 1D, you'll be just fine with the 50mm lens for portraits.

I'd prefer more beginner friendly material, but I do welcome more advance topics.\n\nSo could someone suggest some good 2D collision response articles/books?\n\n(PS: I'm more interested in response than detection)",
        "answer": "How much detail do you need? Answering some of these questions would help you eliminate packages that don't do what you need.\n\nDo you have to worry about object rotation? Then you need to be concerned about lever arms, angular momentum, moments of inertia, and torques.\n\nDo you have to worry about deformation? Then you need to get into finite element analysis, stress/strain, etc. -- something that describes how the objects respond internally to external forces.\n\nWhat about frictional effects? Then you'll need coefficients of friction, or possibly velocity models for air resistance.\n\nGravitational effects? Electromagnetic effects? Other forces?",

        "question": "I've been trying so long at this problem to no avail. I drew my free body diagram, but I'm unsure which formula to use.\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fVuw2.png)\n\nCould someone help me out?",
        "answer": "You seem to be misunderstanding the depth of the prediction we've made of the past in saying that the Big Bang happened. You do make a very valid point that chaotic systems even with as few elements as the solar system are practically impossible to past-predict (I'm going to start using the word \"postdict\"1 because it makes me feel better). I'm more than willing to admit that we have no way of knowing where Earth was around the Sun 4.5 billion years ago. However, I'm sure you would agree that what we can say is that Earth was in orbit of the Sun 4.5 billion years ago. Earth is orbiting the Sun now, there is no evidence that it is an extrasolar capture, and we estimate its age at about 4.6 billion years. Therefore, we can say it was orbiting the Sun 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nThis may not seem like much of a postdiction, but if, before now, we had absolutely no idea where Earth was at that time, then this statement would become a major breakthrough in our understanding of the history of our solar system. In a similar manner, saying the Big Bang happened is just as deep. We don't know the exact conditions or the distribution of energy at the Big Bang (not yet anyway), but we have the evidence that it happened. We know that space is expanding and that galaxies and other celestial bodies are all moving away from us. We also know that the universe is cooling. We can determine the recessional velocity of objects at different distances and use that to determine the expansion history. Then we can trace this backwards and say that everything must have been contained in an incredibly hot and dense point at about 13.8 billion years in the past. This is our Big Bang era. We aren't saying exactly where things were and how much and what they were doing. Like saying Earth was in orbit of the Sun 4.5 billion years ago, we are saying the universe was a hot, dense, and incredibly small in scale 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nMany models and theories exist that speculate on the initial conditions of the universe or try to establish more of the specifics during the Big Bang era, and can you blame us for being thorough?\n\nI'll try to address as many of your follow up points as I can:\n\nBoth (1) and (2) are based on the idea that we are making postdictions that are too specific for a chaotic system to allow. I've attempted to explain how that is not the case in my above writings. If I have succeeded, then I don't think anything more is necessary for these points. If I haven't succeeded, then I'm not sure what reservations you have, so I'll wait to tackle these points.\n\nYour point (3) is getting into chaotic inflation. Inflationary theories in general only exist to solve problems in the old Big Bang theory. But all inflation theories admit the Big Bang era occurs after inflation, and they also allow for the Big Bang moment before inflation (that is, the curvature singularity). The Big Bang era is the era of a hot, dense universe that is radiation/matter dominated and ends at about the time of recombination. Everyone agrees this happened just like they agree Earth orbited the Sun. Inflation itself (not just chaotic inflation) is a period of rapid expansion, but most physicists agree that there was probably a curvature singularity beforehand.2 There are theories and physicists like the one you quote that say a curvature singularity is unnecessary; that the universe needn't ever have been a point, but that doesn't mean they don't think the Big Bang era or expansion in general was non-existent.\n\nPoint (4) is not something to put a lot of weight on yet. In [another of my answers](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/164569/23473) I specifically addressed this exact paper and detailed how it was too insufficient to to take seriously.\n\nAll in all, the present evidence for the Big Bang is very compelling evidence and the theories involving the Big Bang have made some remarkable predictions that fit the available data very well. It may be true that we cannot postdict the exact state of the universe 13.8 billion years ago. We may even be off in the age by a few billion years, but I maintain that we can say the Big Bang era occurred as surely as we can say that Earth was in orbit of the Sun 4.5 billion years ago.\n\n---\n\n1I looked it up and apparently \"postdict\" *is* a word that means exactly what I was hoping it did. Hooray for consistency of prefixes!\n\n2 See another question and answer of mine for more information on [definitions of the Big Bang as before and/or after inflation](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/132794/is-the-big-bang-defined-as-before-or-after-inflation).",

        "question": "In the movie Inside Out, I found that the personified emotions Anger and Fear inside the main character (Riley) are **male** whereas Joy, Disgust and Sadness are **female**. Is there any reason why it has been designed like that for a 11 year old girl?\n\nIn [the second trailer,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MC3XuMvsDI) we see that the emotions inside the mother are all female, while the ones inside the father are all male. On top of that, while each emotion (Anger, Joy, etc) look alike from person to person, all the emotions inside the mother and the father look like them (The mother's emotions all have her same haircut & glasses, the father's have his haircut & mustache).\n\nIs there a in world or out of universe explanation for the mix & match look of Riley's emotions?\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tc2rD.jpg)",
        "answer": "Director Pete Docter and Pixar founder John Lasseter explain why Riley's emotions are mixed while her parents' are not.\n\nFirst, the parents' emotions are due to both emotional development and story and acting flow:\n\n> \n> I [Docter] remember, we talked to John and he said, \u2018Well, I thought you did it because, as adults, we become more kind of set in our ways. As a kid, you can... anywhere is possible.\u2019\n> \n> \n> Docter said that they were ultimately two things that were absolutely vital to the scene: clarity and comedy. Had Riley\u2019s parents both had multi-gendered emotions like their daughter, the scene would have been going back between 18 different characters, and it was a bit unruly unless everyone was identifiable. Not only did making the emotions gender specific in the parents make the sequence easier to follow, but it also opened up an opportunity to create a few extra laughs.   \n>  Explained the director:   \n> \n> **For the comedy of it, we\u2019re cutting between 18 characters and 4 locations in that dinner scene, so we just went broad with it - kind of how SNL would do it. They all have like dopey obvious mustaches or big red glasses so that you\u2019re instantly clear on, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s mom; it\u2019s dad.\u2019** <http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Inside-Out-Main-Character-Has-Male-Female-Emotions-72176.html>\n> \n> \n> \n\nSo the parents are simplified to make the scene easier to follow, and because as Adults, they have already developed their adult personality/emotions. Riley has not yet.\n\n> \n> ***Interviewer:*** *What was the thought process behind the genders of the emotions?*  \n> \n> **Docter:** Again, it was intuitive. It felt to me like Anger's very masculine, I don't know why. And then some of it came to casting... Sadness felt a little more feminine and Mindy Kahling as Disgust felt right. And someone balanced too. Plus the female roles lead because it's inside a girl. With mom and dad, we skewed them all male and all female for a quick read, because you have to understand where we are, which is a little phony but hopefully people don't mind! <http://www.empireonline.com/empireblogs/empire-states/post/p1463>\n> \n> \n> \n\nSo in short, Riley's emotions are mixed because, as a pre-teen, she's likely not to have developed a strict outer personality. She's still growing, and developing her own style. She's still raw and malleable, impressionable. Secondary to this is of course the rule of funny. Having some of the emotions as male is purely for show.",

        "question": "The initial successes of Chinese military in Korean War against high odds can be said to be a major blunder on the part of MacArthur's military leadership. We know that MacArthur did not make particular preparations. But what were his available options in preparation for the Chinese intervention?\n\nI am asking about the operational aspects. MacArthur himself proposed air interdiction along Yalu River and bombing inside China as the means of defense against Chinese intervention. In fact, he presented them as the only option. But such proposals were after the fact -- not in advance of Chinese intervention when he had the freedom to establish other lines of defense. In any case, such actions were strictly forbidden from the parameters MacArthur was given to operate in. I am not aware of any other proposals at time. Were there other available options? Say, alternative force dispositions -- a defensive line somewhere away from Yalu River that would have forestalled PVA's offensive? On paper, the UN Command had a large force. Were there reasons for what MacArthur proposed to be the only possible defense?\n\nFor full disclosure, MacArthur at one point argued to Joint Chiefs of Staff that a defensive perimeter along the waist of Korean peninsula was infeasible -- on top of the mountains and hills northeastward. If that was true, there was no further available options to MacArthur. However, that seems to me a one-time claim of his and of dubious nature. As in, unless you find corroborating evidence elsewhere, I question whether that was even a result of MacArthur's own analysis. (For a motive to make rash claims, he made many arguments not exactly but effectively for escalating the conflict with China, which means he had a different strategic vision for US than the persons higher in chain of command that he seemed eager to advance.) As well, the argument was made after the casualties and setbacks were inflicted by the initial Chinese offensives -- not before when he had more to work with. \n\nThere are of course the more strategic, more political aspects that anyone is welcome to comment on.\n\nBack to the initial question, unless some strategic reasons render it vacuous, were there actions available to MacArthur that would have forestalled the Chinese offensive?\n\nThis question is not a hypothetical; it asks what options were available to MacArthur. Every historical actor chooses actions from a set of potential actions constrained by strategic objectives, physical and economic realities, etc.",
        "answer": "> \n> **Statement:** The initial successes of Chinese military in Korean War **against high odds** can be said to be a major blunder on the part of MacArthur's military leadership. \n> \n> \n> \n\nThe initial successes of Chinese military came because of their huge numerical advantage not as you say **against high odds**. On Nov. 25-26, 1950, **[300,000 Chinese troops](https://www.deseret.com/2014/11/26/20553621/this-week-in-history-china-enters-the-korean-war)** attacked American and U.N. forces in North Korea. On 1 September 1950 the **[United Nations Command had a strength of 180,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Command)** in Korea: 92,000 were South Koreans, the balance being Americans and the 1,600-man British 27th Infantry Brigade.\n\n> \n> **Question**:  \n> \n>  What options were available to MacArthur to prepare for Chinese intervention in the Korean War?\n> \n> \n> \n\nChina entering the Korean War was a strategic reordering episode of the war. MacArthur's permission to advance beyond the 38th parallel was prefaced with the exclusion of Chinese or Soviet involvement.\n\n> \n> **[An Overview of US Army in the Korean War](https://www.nj.gov/military/korea/factsheets/army.html)**  \n> \n>  Truman authorized MacArthur to send his forces north of the 38th parallel on Sept. 27, provided there was no indication that major Soviet or Chinese Communist Forces (CCF) would enter the war. The U.N. General Assembly approved the UNC's entry into North Korea 10 days later, when it called for the restoration of peace and security throughout Korea. American and ROK Army forces rapidly advanced northward. \n> \n> \n> \n\n.  \n\nChina's ultimate massive involvement was thus not military failure under MacArthur's control but rather a failed political gamble by policy makers. Gambling advancing into N. Korea against the larger global concerns China's involvement entailed. Washington Policy makers concerns were if china was threatened the Soviet Union and the Soviet Bomb would also enter the war. This could mean expanding the war and even potentially a Soviet Invasion of Europe. These global concerns which ultimately dictated strategies for the UN forces in Korea were outside of MacArthur's mandate. \n\nMacArthur's ultimate dismissal as commander of UN forces in Korea had to do with MacArthur's differences with Washington on how to respond to the Chinese offensive. MacArthur sought to widen the war, exactly what Washington did not want to do. MacArthur wanted to involve Chinese Republican troops from Taiwan, Bomb Chinese staging areas inside of China, perhaps use America's nuclear weapons, and ultimately invade and wage war on China directly. Truman elected to contain the war. Block North Korea / China from gaining from the war and keep the war from spreading to involve a European Soviet threat. When it became clear MacArthur was pursuing his own theatre strategy of widening the war, and publicly criticizing Washington, Truman fired him. \n\nOnce MacArthur was dismissed, he was replaced by General Matthew Ridgeway who used rolling artillery followed by infantry advances to great effect in rolling back Chinese gains. But Ridgeway's objectives were different than MacArthur's. Ridgeway never approached the Chinese boarder as MacArthur had done. Ridgeway did cross the 38th parallel but only modestly to capture and hold better defensive lines. After that he fought a defensive war denying the communists any territorial gains from their initial invasion of south Korea, but also denying UN forces the ability to unify the Korea's. \n\n---\n\n---\n\n> \n> **@Argyll** 1) Your troop strength number is dubious.

Its material advantage included numerous ground, air, and sea transport; it had firepower advantage in available artillery and close air support planes; having armor vs no armor.

Just the beginning of china's formal involvement. The beginning of the war was North Korea's invasion of South korea in June of 1950, again when UN forces were at a disadvantage. It's true the UN had air superiority in June-Oct 1950 over the North Korean Airforce. However by Nov 1950 they were fighting the Chinese Airforce and by April they were fighting the Soviet Airforce. Likewise the **[Mig-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-15)**(620 mph) had about a 100 mile per hour advantage over the [American F-80C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-80_Shooting_Star)(top speed of 502 mph) Shooting Star and the US didn't have as many Shooting Star's.

If not, is there a nice counterexample?",
        "answer": "Let me assume that you are speaking about computable reals and functions in the sense of\n[computable analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_analysis), which is one of the most successful approaches to the topic. (One must be careful, since there are several incompatible notions of computability on the reals.)\n\nIn computable analysis, the [computable real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_real_number) are those that can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite, terminating algorithm (e.g. using Turing machines). One should imagine receiving rational approximations to the given real. In this subject, functions on the reals are said to be computable, if there is an algorithm that can compute, for any desired degree of accuracy, the value of the function, for any algorithm that produces approximations to the input with sufficient accuracy. That is, if we want to know f(x) to within epsilon, then the algorithm is allowed to ask for x to within any delta it cares to.\n\nThe **Computable Intermediate Value Theorem** would be the assertion that if f is a computable continuous function and f(a)< c<f(b) for computable reals a, b, c, then there is a computable real d with f(d)=c.\n\nThe book [Computable analysis: an introduction](https://books.google.com/books?id=OPolVWVFDJYC&dq=computable+analysis&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=_QlUjkXhSy&sig=5m7E0aXQ-CVl8HcF77tzW2AW5Pk&hl=en&ei=Eh8pS93oN4Oj8AbDoIW1DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CEIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false) by Klaus Weihrauch discusses exactly this question in Example 6.3.6.\n\nThe basic situation is as follows. The answer is **Yes**. If f happens to be increasing, then the usual bisection proof of existence turns out to be effective. For other f, however, one can use a trisection proof. Theorem 6.3.8 says that if f is computable and f(x)\\*f(z)<0, then f has a computable zero. This implies the Computable Intermediate Value theorem above.\n\nIn contrast, the same theorem also says that there is a non-negative computable continuous function f on [0,1], such that the sets of zeros of f has Lebesgue measure greater than 1/2, but f has no computable zero.\n\nIn summary, if the function crosses the line, you can compute a crossing point, but if it stays on one side, then you might not be able to compute a kissing point, even if it is kissing on a large measure set.",

Then in order to fulfil my requirement I have to draw white balls in first $k-1$ steps. That can be done in $\\binom 9 {k-1} (k-1)!$ ways. For each of these ways remaining $30-k$ balls can be drawn in $(30-k)!$ ways. This $k$ can run from $1$ to $10$. \n\nSo the total number of ways to draw the first white ball before all the black balls is $$\\sum\\limits\\_{k=1}^{10} \\binom 9 {k-1}(k-1)!

        "answer": "The question is rather badly posed. \"The first white ball\" sounds as if it refers to the first white ball drawn, but apparently it's intended to refer to the white ball with the number $1$.\n\nThere's indeed a much simpler way to show that the probability of drawing the white ball with the number $1$ before all black balls is $\\frac1{21}$. Consider the $21$ balls comprising the white ball with the number $1$ and the $20$ black balls. All orders of these $21$ balls are equally likely; in particular, the white ball with the number $1$ is equally likely to be in any of the $21$ positions in this order. Thus the probability for each of the positions, including the first position, is $\\frac1{21}$.\n\nOn how to evaluate your sum, see the [hockey-stick identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey-stick_identity).",

To say that there are true statements of the form \u201cthe Diophantine equation $D(x\\_1, \\ldots, x\\_n) = 0$ has no solution\u201d that are undecidable in PA is to make a purely mathematical statement, not to introduce any philosophically problematic ideas about mathematical truth.\n> \n> \n> Similar remarks apply to the observations made earlier regarding consistent systems and their solutions of problems. It was emphasized that the mere fact of a consistent system S proving, for example, that there are in\ufb01nitely many twin primes by no means implies that the twin prime hypothesis is true. Here again it is often thought that such an observation involves dubious metaphysical ideas. But no metaphysics is involved, only ordinary mathematics. We know that there are consistent theories extending PA that prove false mathematical statements\u2014we know this because this fact is itself a mathematical theorem\u2014and so we have no mathematical basis for concluding that the twin prime conjecture is true, which is to say,that there are in\ufb01nitely many twin primes, from the two premises \u201cPA is consistent\u201d and \u201cPA proves the twin prime hypothesis.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \n\nFrom the earlier paragraphs in the section, it seems that 'mathematical truth' is essentially truth in $\\mathbb{N}$ (or $\\mathbb{R}$, or whatever natural universe we're working in). I believe the point here is that PA is not complete, so there are (or, at least, there could be) consistent extensions S of PA which could prove both that PA is consistent and that the twin prime hypothesis is true. But that these extensions could also state, for instance, that some other theorem of $\\mathbb{N}$ is false. So the statements 'PA is consistent' and 'PA proves the twin prime hypothesis' formally imply that the twin prime hypothesis is true, but care should be taken as to what consistent system this is being proved in (in particular, what system is proving that PA proves the twin prime hypothesis).\n\nBut there's nothing wrong with your reasoning. If $PA \\vdash \\phi$, then of course $\\mathbb{N} \\vDash \\phi$.",

        "answer": "Generally, with audio system noise on cars I look for three kinds of things. First the most common source of noise is from an alternator. For example if the alternator has a failed diode there will be a very loud audio whine associated with it.\n\nThe second most common source of problems is with grounding. For example if there is a receiver, couple to an audio amplifier as an add-on unit for louder volume or for subwoofer comma and the units are not bonded together effectively, there can be current loops and other types of problems which can cause bad audio. These problems can be hard to track down, and the fastest way to resolve them is to run a wire between each unit making sure that it has effective bonding to the housing of the unit with screws.\n\nThe third most common source of problems is load related. For example a heavy load such as a cooling fan turning on and off rapidly can make clicking noises and thumping noises in an audio system. These problems are easier to find, especially if you have some instrumentation to detect the changing in load.\n\nAnd your case, I would be very suspicious of your RCA to low-impedance converter. If you have poor bonding of that unit, or there is an impedance mismatch, then that connection is more susceptible to noise, including things like what would ordinarily be minor such as a tiny bit of alternator whine which many alternators will have even if they don't have a bad diode.\n\nTo help you further I think you need to identify for us a better description of your problem, specifically how does it sound, and a better understanding of what the exact connection is and what the devices for your RCA to low-impedance converter. I am wondering comma for example if you really need that converter.\n\nAlso you might indicate what the equipment is for your player and the equipment is for your amplifier. Try to find the specification for the amplifier input and for the player output. My guess is that there is some kind of a mismatch either level wise or more likely impedance wise which is causing your problem.\n\nSo it is possible that the filtering in your player is defective...At least on output. Can you connect the output of the player to a headphone? \n\nAlso please do one more thing...Make sure things work right without the engine running but with everything connected the way you want it to be.\n\nThere when there is one additional thing that I have to bring up. That is that impedance mismatch as can make motor boating noises. It's not exactly with the engine RPM but it may vary with the voltage of the system, which varies a little bit with engine RPM. We need to make sure that your system is not motorboating. If you have the car idling and you have a certain noise comma and then you rapidly Zoom the engine, does the pitch change immediately? Or does it lag the zoom of the engine?",

Then keeping a count of how many times I multiply 2\\*2 until it is greater than than $n$. For example for n=5, 2\\*2\\*2=8, number of two's is 3 so then $f(n)$ is 3. I don't know how to translate this to the ticker tape of the Turing machine.\n\nBut would something like this work? Put $n$ 1's on the tape followed by a 0. Compute 1^(2^1), then check if 1's on the left of the 0 on the tape is less than or equal to the 1's on the right of the 0. If its not then repeat it for 1^(2^(1)).

        "answer": "In general terms, there are the $O(n^2)$ sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, bubble sort, and selection sort, which you should typically use only in special circumstances; Quicksort, which is worst-case $O(n^2)$ but quite often $O(n\\log n)$ with good constants and properties and which can be used as a general-purpose sorting procedure; the $O(n\\log n)$ algorithms, like merge-sort and heap-sort, which are also good general-purpose sorting algorithms; and the $O(n)$, or linear, sorting algorithms for lists of integers, such as radix, bucket and counting sorts, which may be suitable depending on the nature of the integers in your lists.\n\nIf the elements in your list are such that all you know about them is the total order relationship between them, then optimal sorting algorithms will have complexity $\\Omega(n\\log n)$. This is a fairly cool result and one for which you should be able to easily find details online. The linear sorting algorithms exploit further information about the structure of elements to be sorted, rather than just the total order relationship among elements.\n\nEven more generally, optimality of a sorting algorithm depends intimately upon the assumptions you can make about the kind of lists you're going to be sorting (as well as the machine model on which the algorithm will run, which can make even otherwise poor sorting algorithms the best choice; consider bubble sort on machines with a tape for storage). The stronger your assumptions, the more corners your algorithm can cut. Under very weak assumptions about how efficiently you can determine \"sortedness\" of a list, the optimal worst-case complexity can even be $\\Omega(n!)$.\n\nThis answer deals only with complexities. Actual running times of implementations of algorithms will depend on a large number of factors which are hard to account for in a single answer.",

For example, \n\n```\nname = os.path.basename(source.name)\nprefix, suffix = os.path.splitext(name)\n_, filepath = tempfile.mkstemp(prefix=prefix, suffix=suffix, dir=MEDIA_ROOT)\n\n```\n\nbut it would be better if you use [`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile), as then the file-like object is returned (so you don't have to create fobj from the filename and the temp file is deleted by default when done). \n\n```\nfobj, _ = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(prefix=prefix, suffix=suffix, dir=MEDIA_ROOT)\nshutil.copyfileobj(source, fobj)\n\n```",

        "answer": "The Eurozone isn't a separate entity from the European Union, but an umbrella term for the countries that have reached the [third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/introducing_euro_practical_aspects/ec0015_en.htm). Technically all member states of the EU that have met the [convergence criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria) are required to adopt the Euro, with the notable exceptions of Denmark and the United Kingdom who managed to obtain special opt outs in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht.\n\nAccording to Article 50 (3) of the [Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:en:PDF), if a country withdraws from the European Union all treaties regarding the EMU, starting with the Treaty of Maastricht, will no longer apply, which effectively means that a Eurozone member withdrawing from the EU will also be withdrawing from the Eurozone:\n\n> \n> 3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.\n> \n> \n> \n\nThat said, the [previous paragraph](https://politics.stackexchange.com/a/500/101) allows for the withdrawing member to negotiate its future relationship with the EU, without excluding the possibility of the withdrawing member continuing being part of the EMU or any other specific treaty or sets of treaties. Thus, it is theoretically possible for the withdrawing member to remain within the Eurozone, although it seems highly improbable that the European Parliament will give its consent, especially since 2004 opting out of the third stage of the EMU is not allowed for past or future EU members.\n\nLastly, there is nothing legally stopping a country that has withdrawn from the EU to adopt or continue using the Euro as its national currency, similarly to how Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican City, Kosovo, Montenegro and Andorra have adopted the Euro without being members of the EU and without being represented in the Euro Group. This seems like a far more likely possibility, assuming of course that the withdrawing member is interested in adopting or continuing using the Euro.",

So which one is correct? The first text or the second?\n\nA developer answer or an official errata if it exists would be preferable.",
        "answer": "2 Wraiths and 4 Specters is correct\n===================================\n\n1. Nothing precludes 6 people turning into 4 monsters\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nMaybe two of them aren't important enough to get their own \"body\" (excuse the lack therof). Maybe some of them fused into each other to create a total of four specters. Or maybe something killed some of them (such as the yuan ti that were exploring). It doesn't really matter the exact cause, because there's no conservation of energy law for turning cultists / snakes into specters.\n\n2. The xp cost lines up for a deadly adventure with 6 creatures\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe party should start the adventure around level 7, and there's one milestone between the start and now. That brings us up to level 8. Hard XP for four level-8 characters is 5600 and Deadly is 8400. XP spent for 2 wraiths and 4 specters is 8800, close enough; whereas XP spent for an additional 2 specters is 12000, WAY over. Even if the party were level-9 at this point, that would still be 2500xp over budget.\n\n3. Lastly, and leastly, devs make mistakes.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIt is entirely possible (I will say nothing of the probability) that it was supposed to say \"two and two\" or \"one and three\" or whatever and whoever was writing missed it. OR, if it *is* a mistake, I find it most likely that an earlier revision had 6 specters and they forgot to change the text.\n\n---\n\nAddendum: WotC Support says \"2 wraiths, 4 specters\"\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nI emailed [Wizards of the Coast's support team](https://support.wizards.com/hc/en-us). I hadn't used it before; kinda a mixed bag.\n\n> \n> Thank you for reaching out to Wizards of the Coast Customer Support, Based on the challenge ratings in the Dungeon Master's Guide it appears the 2 wraiths and 4 specters would be the appropriate encounter rather than 2 wraiths and 6 specters per the additional text. Again, The final word on any additions or other modifications to the encounter would be entirely at the DM's discretion.

        "answer": "To answer your question, as Mike stated in his answer, no, they are not standard.\n\nSomething you could do if you are looking to put switches into these slots is look to a wrecking yard (ie: bone yard; breakers; eBay listing) for switches which *would* go in here. Since Toyota put the panel in there with the blanks, you can rightfully *assume* Toyota has switches which will fit into these slots. There has to be Toyota made switches which go into these slots otherwise Toyota would not have made the slots in the first place. I personally don't know what these switches would be for, but you can have a pretty high probability these switches exist. It costs money to design/make the panel where the switches go. They *would* put it in there as a scale of economy thing, meaning, why have two separate panels when a single panel with switch holes will work for both ... just don't put switches in panels where they aren't needed.\n\nYou can see in this image, there is a switch located in the panel to the left of the steering wheel. It looks as though it could be for stability control (who knows!).

Pairs are compared first-to-second element. **If the first element*s* are not equal**, the result will be based on the comparison of the first elements only; the second elements will be compared only if the first ones are equal. The array (or vector) of pairs can easily be sorted by STL internal functions.\n> \n> \n> \n\nand hence this\n\n> \n> For example, if you want to sort the array of integer points so that they form a polygon, it\u2019s a good idea to put them to the `vector< pair<double, pair<int,int> >`, where each element of vector is `{ polar angle, { x, y } }`. One call to the STL sorting function will give you the desired order of points.\n> \n> \n> \n\nI have been struggling for an hour to understand this.  \n\n[Source](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/)",
        "answer": "Consider looking at `operator<` for `pair<A,B>`, which is a class that looks something like:\n\n```\nstruct pairAB {\n    A a;\n    B b;\n};\n\n```\n\nYou could translate that paragraph directly into code:\n\n```\nbool operator<(const pairAB& lhs, const pairAB& rhs) {\n    if (lhs.a != rhs.a) {         // If the first elements are not equal\n        return lhs.a < rhs.a;     // the result will be based on \n    }                             // the comparison of the first elements only\n\n    return lhs.b < rhs.b;         // the second elements will be compared\n                                  // only if the first ones are equal.\n}\n\n```\n\nOr, thinking more abstractly, this is how lexicographic sort works. Think of how you would order two words. You'd compare their first letters - if they're different, you can stop and see which one is less. If they're the same, then you go onto the second letter.",

Name it according to the meaning of its contents and not its type.\n\nYou have a habit of casting sequences that don't need to be cast, as in\n\n```\n       self.boundary_coordinates.append(list([tuple((x, x + width)), tuple((y, y + height))]))\n\n```\n\nThat's really just\n\n```\nself.boundary_coordinates.append(\n    [\n        (x, x + width), (y, y + height),\n    ]\n)\n\n```\n\nThis:\n\n```\ndef sign(x):\n    return ((x >= 0) << 1) - 1\n\n```\n\nis tricky and unnecessary. Just use `np.sign`.\n\n`ax.patch.set_linewidth('2')` will never work; that string needs to be a numeric literal.\n\n`-(CORRECTED_CANVAS_RADIUS)` should not have parens.\n\n`rec` exists in `init_particles`, so already has access to a `self` in closure scope; don't write it again in the signature to `rec`. `x` and `y` are never used in the signature either, so delete them too.\n\n`get_random_canvas_value` should be moved out to a `staticmethod` of `Simulation`; and don't repeat it - stop copying and pasting code.\n\nThis loop makes no sense:\n\n```\n        while (x, y) in mem:\n            return rec(self, x, y)\n\n```\n\nThat's really just an `if` and not a `while`.\n\n`rec` should be redesigned so that it does not recurse. This is a stack overflow waiting to happen.\n\nThis list comprehension:\n\n```\n        x, y = [self.get_random_canvas_value() for _ in range(2)]\n\n```\n\nshould be left as a generator `()` and not a list `[]`. Likewise, all of the inner list comprehensions in `get_bounds` should be converted to generators; basically delete the `[]`.\n\n`colors` and `markers` should be tuples.\n\n`numberOfParticles` should be `number_of_particles` by PEP8.\n\n`get_bounds` is unused so delete it.\n\nYou should use floor division here:\n\n```\nstep: int = int((RADIUS << 1) // NUMBER_OF_COMPARTMENTS_PER_DIRECTION)\n\n```\n\nYour use of `<<` and `>>` in an attempt to speed up multiplication and division by two is premature optimisation, and there are areas of your program that have comparatively gigantic inefficiencies. Just do the comprehensible thing and write `2`. And anyway: *you have a fixed framerate*. So long as that framerate is being hit, there is no point whatsoever in attempting micro-optimisation.\n\nIt would be a good idea to make `get_nanodomain_coordinates` a property as you have, but in that case delete \"get\\_\" since its invocation is variable-like and not method-like. However. You have variables with those names already, so do the opposite: remove `@property` from those methods.\n\nYou mix built-in `random` with `np.random`. Don't do that. Probably use `np.random` only.\n\nDon't write no-assignment comprehensions such as `[self.update_path(i) for i in range(self.n_particles)]`. Just write a loop.\n\nComprehensions are not helping in `handle_hop_diffusion`. Just expand it to a regular loop:\n\n```\ndef handle_hop_diffusion(ax: plt.Axes, sim: HopDiffusion):\n    for param in sim.boundary_coordinates_for_plot:\n        boundary = plt.Rectangle(  # type: ignore\n            tuple((param[0], param[1])),\n            param[2], param[3],\n            color='black',\n            alpha=0.7,\n            clip_on=False,\n        )\n        ax.add_patch(boundary)\n\n```\n\n`type` as a parameter needs to go away. You already know the type - use `isinstance()` on the `sim` variable.\n\n`Simulation` is effectively an abstract class. You need an `update` stub on it:\n\n```\n    def update(self) -> None:\n        raise NotImplementedError()\n\n```\n\nThis statement has no effect, so delete it:\n\n```\nnew_surrounding_boundary_idx = self.get_surrounding_boundary_of_particle(new_pos)\n\n```\n\nYou have a latent bug. `for i in range(6):` hard-codes the number of compartments, when that should really be derived from `NUMBER_OF_COMPARTMENTS_PER_DIRECTION`. The moment that that constant changes, your code will not do what you want. Likewise, `for _ in range(5):` hard-codes the particle count instead of using the count parameter set in `n_particles`.\n\nFirst pass\n----------\n\nA first pass covering much of the above looks like:\n\n```\nimport random\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import rcParams  # type: ignore\nfrom matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation  # type: ignore\n\nDPI = 100\nRADIUS_PADDING = 10\nRADIUS = 250\nCORRECTED_CANVAS_RADIUS = RADIUS -

I have never used skype, I do not know how to work that program. But, the cell phone company submitted a history of calls made. I called several of these numbers and I do not know the party on the other line. I even asked them if they have ever spoke with me or even recognized my voice, and they said they didn't know me or recognized my voice.\nSo my question is, is it possible that the cell phone company or someone close to me could have rigged (for better lack of word) my phone to create such a long list?",

        "answer": "For a default parameter having generic (dependent on template parameters) type, you don't want `= 0` (which is what you get with the `NULL` macro). It'll select a converting constructor for `std::string` instead of the default constructor, and that converting constructor forbids passing a null pointer value. The crash is a consequence of violating that precondition.\n\nYou also don't want default initialization, which leaves primitives with no initialization at all. The C++ concept of \"value-initialization\" serves you well here... default construction for types with non-trivial construction, and zero initialization otherwise.\n\nGood options then are copy-initialization from a value-initialized default, or the very handy list-initialization with an empty list, which is very short syntactically and also works for aggregates (since C++11 it gives value-initialization for scalar types, before that it was only useful for aggregates):\n\n```\n/* C++03 value-initialization */\nexplicit Belief(std::string UniqueName, factType InitialFact = factType())\n\n/* list-initialization, since C++11 this also works great for scalars */\nexplicit Belief(std::string UniqueName, factType InitialFact = {})\n\n```",

        "question": "In Java, all variables containing proper objects are actually references (i.e. pointers). Therefore, method calls with these objects as arguments are always \"by reference\". Calling a method which modifies the state of the object also affects the original object (on the caller side).\n\nC++ is different: Here arguments can be passed by value or passed by reference. Calling a mutator method on an object which was passed by value leaves the original object unaffected. (I suppose call by value creates a local copy of the object).\n\nSo my first response to this - coming from Java to C++ - is: ALWAYS use pointers when using objects as arguments. This gives me the behavior I have come to expect from Java.\n\nHowever, one could also use \"call by value\" in case one does not need to modify the object in the method body. Are there reasons why one would want to do this?",
        "answer": "You're wrong in that you should pass by pointer. If you want to pass by reference, well... simply pass by reference:\n\n```\nvoid foo(int& x)\n{\n   x = 3;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n   int a = 0;\n   foo(a);\n   assert( a == 3 );\n}\n\n```\n\nAlso, note that passing by value guarantees that the your variable can't be changed inside the called context.

Then give it a `margin:0 auto;` or a `text-align:center` on the parent to center it.\n\nHOWEVER, You are *not allowed to put `<div>`s inside of `<buttons>`*. **it is invalid HTML**\n\nSee this answer for more information:\n[Why can't a <button> element contain a <div>?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15885444/why-cant-a-button-element-contain-a-div)\n\nOr, you could read here, from W3 that only phrasing content is expected to be used within a button:\n<https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html5-20120329/the-button-element.html#the-button-element>\n\nIf you do not know what phrasing content is, See this page:\n<https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html5-20120329/content-models.html#phrasing-content>\n\n-- if you are looking into styling buttons specifically, maybe this very short tutorial would help:\n<http://web.archive.org/web/20110721191046/http://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element/>\n\nHere is a fiddle of a working button like yours:\n<https://jsfiddle.net/68w6m7rr/>\n\nI honestly didn't have many problems with this.

Why not start with a half ounce of flour and just add the same weight as what's in the container? (I plan to try this.) On the fifth day, feeding once a day, there would be 8 ounces of flour.",
        "answer": "In the beginning of a starter's life, the point is to develop yeast and friendly bacteria, NOT develop lots of starter. If you don't discard, you end up with way too much, and it is not wasteful because tossing about half keeps everything at a manageable amount. You don't want too little either because as was mentioned, there needs to be enough there to keep it fresh and good. The pioneers coming access America in covered wagons had no refrigerators yet their starters did good because they were populated with wenough yeast and bacteria to stay that way. Everyone suggests about a cup of starter, a cup of fur and either 1/2 cup or 2/3 cup water, and this has worked well for me.

Depending on how big an overlap there is between `b` and `c`, you can pick either `UNION` or `UNION ALL`:\n\n* `WHERE (a) NOT IN (b UNION c)` removes duplicates between `b` and `c` which adds a small cost initially but can speed things up later when `a` is compared against the effectively smaller union.\n* `WHERE (a) NOT IN (b UNION ALL c)` skips deduplication, so if by design there can't be any, it's the better choice.\n\nHere's a [demo](https://dbfiddle.uk/cOwPJ7Kl) showing how plans change. Locally, I also tested a delete from 120m row table against 2x 10m tables with 99% overlap and got 118s for initial version, 105s for `union`, 98s for `union all`. With all the same counts and no overlap, it was 118s, 103s, 95s. With more columns and more complex types, I expect the difference to be more pronounced.\n\nI figured I'd make my [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74500008/simplifying-where-not-in-and-where-not-in/74506515#comment131511620_74500008) into an answer, adding the tests that followed, leaving the broader optimisation to be discussed in the [new thread](https://stackoverflow.com/q/74507911/5298879).",

        "answer": "GitHub provides two main ways to access a repository: HTTPS and SSH. If you've set up an SSH key in your account's settings, then you should be able to use it to push to any repository you have access to *provided you're using SSH*. However, if you're being prompted to use a username and password, then you're using HTTPS, not SSH, since GitHub does not offer username and password access over the SSH protocol.\n\nIf you want to use SSH with a different repository, go to the repository in the web interface and copy the SSH URL from the drop-down. Then go into that repository and run `git remote -v`. That should show you all the remotes that you have and their URLs. Assuming the remote name you want to change is called `origin`, run the following where `URL` is the SSH URL you've copied:\n\n```\n$ git remote set-url origin URL\n\n```\n\nThat will set up that repository to use SSH instead of HTTPS.",

A lot of headfuzz to get around.\n\nbasically the person I am inheriting it from created a basic controller from MVC and we can call the MVC site as we normally do.\n\nI can also do JSON calls to the controller action which gives us back some data in a ViewModel. Great.\nBut when you browse to the site using umbraco and navigate to that same page, we run into big problems such as not being able to invoke the JSON call to get the data as it says object not found (in other words, the controller action is not found).\n\nI read about umbraco basically overriding the default MVC routings but... why such a mess? :)\n\nhow can I integrate an existing MVC site into umbraco without much pain?\nwhat is the url to call a controller action in umbraco integration?\n\nsay we have this:\n\n```\npublic JsonResult GetPersonDetail(int id)\n{\n   var vm = new AjaxPersonDetailViewModel(....);\n   return new JsonResult( Data = vm };\n}\n\n```\n\nI can call this in JQuery like so:\n\n/MyController/GetPersonDetail/1\n\nso how do I do that with Umbraco?",
        "answer": "I just had this problem and based on the answer [here](https://discuss.wxpython.org/t/how-can-i-preventing-a-dialog-box-to-close/30006) I came up with the solution below. This was tested using wxPython 4.1.0 and python 3.8.5.\n\nIn essence, all `wx.EVT_BUTTON` events in the `wx.Dialog` window are bound to a method in the `wx.Dialog` window. In the method, the ID of the clicked button is compared to the IDs used to create the buttons in the `wx.Dialog` and actions are taken accordingly.\n\nIn the example below, clicking the OK button generates a random number. The `wx.Dialog` only closes if the random number is > 0.5.\n\n```\nimport random\nimport wx\n\nclass Example(wx.Frame):\n    \"\"\"Main window \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, parent):\n        super().__init__(\n            parent, \n            title = 'Intercept wx.Dialog button events',\n            size  = (260, 180),\n        )\n        self.btn = wx.Button(self, label = 'Show Dialog Window')\n        self.Sizer = wx.BoxSizer()\n        self.Sizer.Add(self.btn, 0, wx.ALIGN_CENTER|wx.ALL, 5)\n        self.SetSizer(self.Sizer)\n        self.btn.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.OnDialog)\n        self.Centre()\n        self.Show()\n\n    def OnDialog(self, event):\n        with MyDialog(self) as dlg:\n            if dlg.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:\n                print(\"Dialog closed with OK - Message from Main Window\")\n                print(\"\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Dialog closed with Cancel - Message from Main Window\")\n                print(\"\")\n\nclass MyDialog(wx.Dialog):\n    def __init__(self, parent):\n        super().__init__(\n            parent, \n            title = 'My Dialog',\n            size  = (220, 90),\n        )\n        self.btnSizer = self.CreateStdDialogButtonSizer(\n            wx.OK|wx.CANCEL\n        )\n        self.Sizer = wx.BoxSizer()\n        self.Sizer.Add(self.btnSizer, 0, wx.ALIGN_CENTER|wx.ALL, 5)\n        self.SetSizer(self.Sizer)\n        self.CentreOnParent()\n        # HERE IS THE TRICK, Get all Button events\n        self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.OnButton)\n\n    def OnButton(self, event):\n        \"\"\"Process the OK button click\"\"\"\n        clicked_button_id = event.GetEventObject().GetId()\n        if clicked_button_id == wx.ID_OK:\n            print(\"Processing OK button click\")\n            if (n := random.random()) > 0.5:\n                #--> Everything fine, window will close\n                print(n, \"> 0.5.

There is obviously something going on, as you can see both RWY32 & RWY33 markings in the image, while Jeppesen clearly identifies it as 33.\n\nIf that kink is actually there, what impact does that have on a pilot landing? I believe the touchdown target is the two long, solid bars at the top left of the image, which excludes the kink, however, there is enough rubber to indicate that touchdowns have occurred much closer to the threshold than that.",
        "answer": "FWIW, the other end of 32/33 is labeled 14L. This means (I believe) it is the left of a pair of runways at heading (as you enter it) 140\u00b0. Thus the 32/33 end should be labeled 140+180 = 320\u00b0, i.e., 32, and since it's now on the right it would be 32R. I measured the actual heading, taking horizontal on my screen to be true east-west (not necessarily so, depending on the details of Google's geographic projection) and got 323\u00b0, also consistent with 32 as the correct number. Finally, the kink occurs where a distinct change in background color happens, as one sees often and which is presumably where two different images were joined. The duplicate numbers are in the overlap region. The 33 is bogus (but where it comes from I can't see at all).",

Is this reading correct? Where does the phrase the \"edge of doom\" come from? At first when I read it, I thought that the \"edge of doom\" was a dark reference (similar to \"mask of gloom\"), but it seems to be closer to a wedding vow, such as \"Our marriage will last unto the edge of doom\".",
        "answer": "Your reading of the poem makes sense. It might help to know that the dark trees are symbolizing the future in this poem. The second line tells us that these trees rarely show a breeze. This means that we cannot predict the future. \n\nIn the fourth line, Frost expresses his wish that those dark trees in the first line were stretched away to the edge of doom. This means that he hoped that the future is stretched far away. So, the edge of doom means here far away (in time).

        "question": "I'm trying to gain some understanding of non-diatonic chord sequences and why they work. \n\nI've been listening to the Thomas the Tank Engine theme tune which I believe is in the key of C Major and the second chord is an Ab. It fits harmonically, but why? \n\nAnd a wider question - are there any go-to resources for understanding non-diatonic chord choices and harmony?",
        "answer": "Consecutive chords of the same flavour - major triads, minor triads, 7\u266d5\u266f11 chords - 'work'.\n\nBut not in a functional way. Not in a 'this is a tonic, a dominant, a subdominant' way. Not in a way that lets us predict the next chord and feel a resolution if the prediction is followed through, a pleasant surprise if it isn't.\n\nI think the real answer to this sort of question - why does a non-functional bit of harmony work? - is that it DOESN'T 'work'. And it doesn't have to. It isn't playing that game.\n\nA functional chord progression 'works'. This - C going to Ab - just 'is'. It's not playing the game of 'working'.\n\nWe can justify a C - Ab progression with talk of common tones, or lable it as a 'chromatic mediant'. But look at some other chords that could have been chosen. Apart from not being the 'right' one that we're familiar with in the 'Thomas' tune, wouldn't any of these (and many more) be OK? (And notice I've thrown in one that ISN'T a major triad :-)\n\n'Functional' can be defined as harmony where chords function as tonic, subdominant or dominant. Within that framework, we can discuss whether a progression 'works' or not. We can analyse a progression of this sort in functional terms. With non-functional harmony we can't analyse so much as just describe.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqCHK.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pqCHK.png)",

        "answer": "An async lambda is just a simple way of creating a delegate which is asynchronous. There's nothing to say that the method which contains it has to be doing *anything* asynchronous itself - and any `await` expressions within the lambda expression won't make the containing method wait (unless it's awaiting a task which happens to rely on the delegate, of course).\n\nBasically the lambda expression is *expressing* some asynchronous code - it's not *executing* the asynchronous code itself... so the containing method isn't necessarily executing asynchronously.\n\nYes, the example you've given is a misuse of async lambdas - but making the method async wouldn't improve matters at all, and it would simply be misleading.\n\nEDIT: As an alternative way of thinking about it, consider this refactoring of your original code:\n\n```\npublic void SaveSome()\n{\n    Action<int> action = SaveRepAsync;\n    Array.ForEach(Enumerable.Range(0,3).ToArray(), action);\n}\n\nprivate static async void SaveRepAsync(int x)\n{\n    await SaveRep();\n}\n\n```\n\nThe `SaveSome` method has *nothing* asynchronous about it - only the `SaveRepAsync` method does... so that's what requires the `async` modifier. This really is just a tiny refactoring of your code (the sort of refactoring the compiler would do, effectively). If you wanted every method containing an async lambda to have the async modifier, that's like saying that in the above code, `SaveSome` should have the modifier too... which would make no sense, IMO.",

        "question": "From launch to land could a person travel in space with only mechanical devices like a sextant? With enough experience what would be the minimum devices needed? Which vehicle currently would be easier to fly this way?",
        "answer": "You can travel in space without any navigation devices or computers at all, establishing suborbital flight and orbital flight is done by the rocket, it's accuracy there that matters and early manned rockets had no computers. De-orbiting is a matter of setting up the spacecraft to the right attitude for retro fire, which can be done by eye if need be, early spacecraft used gyros for that with a manual backup. \n\nIf you want to get anywhere specific in space you have to be accurate. A spacecraft must be held in a specific position and engines must fire at exactly the right time and for the right amount of time. Gyroscopes and timers can give you a fair amount of accuracy, so you don't need a computer for that (although it really helps).\n\nThe biggest challenge without a computer would be the mathematical calculations, which can be done by hand as long as you have a room full of human computers to back you up. Just by yourself it will take you longer perform some calculations than they are worth - by the time you have the answer you're past the point you needed them.",

        "question": "I have created a program in Autohotkey, which creates a few shortcut keys that a whole company with 400 people wants to have installed permanently. The way I imagine the program to work is that a shortcut to the program is added to the Start menu under the Startup folder, so it is automatically and transparently started when the computer is started. The program will keep running all day.\n\nI am a freelancer with no access to the IT department, but indirectly I have seen emails that they insist on that I have to create an MSI file in order to roll the program out onto all these computers. The first issue I have with creating an MSI package is that I do not know how an MSI file can be created based on an .EXE file. The second is that they say that it is very costly for them to create such a file (I believe that means that it costs something like 20.000$ to get it done), therefore they do not want to make frequent updates, while I believe it is essential to be able to quickly adjust the program to new needs and fix bugs.\n\nOn Wednesday, I will have a meeting with them, and I would therefore like to know what kind of arguments they might have for using MSI packages, and why they could not simply create a shortcut to my .EXE file on all these computers (this should not be too hard, should it?). The shortcut should point to the .EXE file, which is located on a file-server so one can simply replace it to update the program (the computers always have access to the file-servers, meaning that there are no laptops).\n\nWhat could their arguments be?",
        "answer": "The MSI packages are so that they can push out the updates through [SCCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Center_Configuration_Manager) or other means. Manually pushing out updates or creating is frankly stupid, unless you work with a trivial number of systems - you would need to log into each system, and do it, while not getting in the way of the user.. It also means a single point of failure and its harder to track down bugs\n\nI do believe while there's a time cost, and its non trivial (that is to say there may be some work involved - especially where there isn't an IDE involved that can hook into installer creation), I rather doubt it would cost 20,000 dollars to do - you might want to take a look at [wix](http://wix.codeplex.com/) to better understand the process.\n\nThere's of course the possibility this is being imposed on them, and they arn't really happy about the whole thing and having to maintain a bit of special purpose software developed by some outsider...",

        "question": "Sometimes, a mathematician dies suddenly, leaving behind very good mathematics that didn't make it through the publication pipeline. For example, it is possible they had a paper entirely ready to submit (maybe even already shared with their network, or on arxiv). Or they might even have submitted the paper and then died before the referee report came back (as referee reports seem to be taking longer and longer, this scenario is becoming increasingly likely, sadly). Rather than have important work hang around forever as unrefereed preprints, perhaps mathematical friends of the deceased would like to see their final work published. Assume that there is reason to believe the recently deceased actually wanted the work published (e.g., a preprint they shared with friends and discussed submitting).\n\n> \n> What is the algorithm for getting the last paper of a recently deceased person published?\n> \n> \n> \n\nIf the mathematician is a huge deal, someone might archive or publish their [nachlass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachlass), as [happened to Gauss](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/326910/gauss-posthumous-publications). But that tends to happen more in other fields like philosophy, whereas I'm asking about submissions to normal math journals, where the paper would be reviewed by a professional mathematician and checked for correctness (and presumably someone, perhaps a student or co-author of the deceased, would make minor changes and corrections).\n\nI know a few people have done this. For example, Georges Maltsiniotis has gotten a lot of Grothendieck's stuff published, including [Pursuing Stacks](https://smf.emath.fr/publications/la-poursuite-des-champs-volume-i). But I imagine some of this was contentious, and I imagine Maltsiniotis already gets too many emails about Grothendieck, so I figured I'd ask here instead of emailing him. A few examples of mathematicians who died suddenly in my field and left important mathematics behind are [Bob Thomason](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/290716/status-of-thomasons-idea-for-a-symmetric-monoidal-model-of-stable-homotopy-fr), [Jean-Louis Loday](http://irma.math.unistra.fr/%7Eloday/) (I note that there are several preprints still on his webpage, and I believe his work with Vallette was finished after his death), [Gaunce Lewis, Mark Steinberger](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201906/rnoti-p864.pdf), and [Mark Mahowald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Mahowald) (who, despite being 81 when he died, still had work in progress that was completed by his co-authors after his death) just to name a few.\n\nI imagine someone has to get the rights to publish the paper. Do those normally pass to next of kin by default? What other steps are necessary that I'm not thinking of? Do people know of journals that have done this before?\n\nLong term, I'd love to see a journal designed to publish papers of mathematicians who died before they could see their last works through the publication process. Depending on how much work was required to get the paper in shape, you can imagine partial credit going to a non-anonymous helper who corrected errors, rewrote proofs, added an introduction, etc. But I'm asking a simpler question now, about how to get it done in the current math publishing world. Because of the nature of the mathematical peer review process, I think this question is a better fit for MathOverflow than Academia.SE. A related but very different question [was asked on MO last month](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/421031/how-to-pass-on-research-posthumously).",
        "answer": "The OP asks for a specific \"step by step process to get a paper published by a deceased person who wrote the paper alone\".\n\nA statement on this was made a few years ago by [COPE](https://publicationethics.org/case/deceased-author) (Committee on Publication Ethics). This involved a case where the manuscript was submitted by the author, who passed away before it was accepted.\n\n1. The first step is to ascertain whether the author intended their work to be published in the present form. Ideally the author has had a chance to respond to referees, but one might make the case that submission to arXiv suffices.\n2. If this is ascertained, then one needs to obtain permission from the legal heirs of the deceased. Which documents are needed would depend on the journal, it should include at least a copyright license and for some journals also a statement of \"no conflict of interest\".\n\nPoint 2 should not pose an obstacle, point 1 is more problematic. Journals generally require a statement to the effect that \"all authors must have read the paper and approve of it\". It would be unusual for a journal to publish a manuscript posthumously if it was uncertain whether or not the author was ready for publication.",

        "question": "Using Angular2 and typescript, I have JSON returned from a webApi and I need to get it into an array of a certain type. I can't figure out how to cast the json to the interface I need.\n\nMy type is this interface:\n\n```\nexport interface Country {\n    Id: number;\n    Name: string;\n}\n\n```\n\nMy mock returns this array:\n\n```\nexport var COUNTRIES: Country[] = [\n    { \"Id\": 11, \"Name\": \"US\" },\n    { \"Id\": 12, \"Name\": \"England\" },\n    { \"Id\": 13, \"Name\": \"Japan\" }\n];\n\n```\n\nHere is my code:\ncountry.service.ts\n\n```\n@Injectable()\nexport class CountryService {\n    private _http = null;\n\n    constructor(http: Http) {\n        this._http = http;\n    }\n\n    getCountries() {\n        return Promise.resolve(COUNTRIES);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThen I call it with this:\n\n```\nexport class CountryPickerComponent {\n    public countries: Country[];\n\n    constructor(private _countryService: CountryService) { }\n\n    getCountries() {\n        this._countryService.getCountries().then(data => this.setData(data));\n    }\n\n    setData(data) {\n        //this.countries = data;\n        this.countries = JSON.parse(data);\n        var q = 1;\n    }\n\n    ngOnInit() {\n        this.getCountries();\n    }\n}  \n\n```\n\nAs you can see, I have a class variable called countries that is an array of the Country interface. This works as expected. (I know I don't need that setData method - it's for debugging)\n\nNext, I changed the service to a wepApi call which returns this json.\n\n```\n\"[{\"name\":\"England\",\"id\":1},{\"name\":\"France\",\"id\":2}]\"\n\n```\n\nI changed the getCountries method in the service to:\n\n```\ngetCountries() {\n    return new Promise(resolve=>\n        this._http.get('http://localhost:63651/Api/membercountry')\n            .subscribe(data => resolve(data.json()))\n    );\n}\n\n```\n\nUsing JSON.parse, I convert this to an array which I can then use in angular2. It works. It creates the array with the data. But it's not an array implementing the Country interface.\n\nNotice that the field names from the JSON are all lower case, but the interface properties starts with an uppercase and I coded to the interface. As a result, when I got the real json it does not work. Is there a way to 'cast' this to the interface, which should throw an error and let me know something is wrong? \n\nMany examples use map in the get as shown below:\n\n```\n  getCountries() {\n        var retVal;\n\n        return new Promise(resolve=>\n            this._http.get('http://localhost:63651/Api/membercountry')\n                .map(ref => ref.json())\n                .subscribe(data => resolve(data.json()))\n        );\n    }\n\n```\n\nI can't find documentation on this. When I try it I never get data but there is no error. No compile error and no runtime error.",

        "answer": "It's generally considered a best practice not to change inputs, although there is nothing preventing your from doing so - those arguments are treated just like variables inside the procedure. For short, simple functions you can get away with it. But if you have a longer, more complex function and you stick to never changing inputs, your code becomes much easier to maintain.\n\nSay you get a date from the user, but you want to go back to the last statement date which is always the last day of the previous month. You can manipulate the argument like\n\n```\nPublic Function LastStatementAmount(ByVal inputDate As Date) As Double\n\n    Dim Return_ As Double\n\n    inputDate = DateSerial(Year(inputDate), Month(inputDate), 0)\n\n    'do calculations here\n\n    LastStatementAmount = Return_\n\nEnd Function\n\n```\n\nand that works. But the better way is to change the variable name to reflect what changes you made to the value\n\n```\nPublic Function LastStatementAmount(ByVal inputDate As Date) As Double\n\n    Dim Return_ As Double\n    Dim stmtDate As Date\n\n    stmtDate = DateSerial(Year(inputDate), Month(inputDate), 0)\n\n    'do calculations here\n\n    LastStatementAmount = Return_\n\nEnd Function\n\n```\n\nIf this were a larger function, it would be better to see `stmtDate` and know that you had already modified the input date.\n\nAnother reason not to change an input parameter, as mentioned in the comments, is that if you don't specify a passing mechanism, the parameter is, by default, ByRef and if the calling procedure is expecting that the value didn't change, you might break the code. You should always specify ByVal or ByRef so it's clear what your code intends.",

        "question": "Just a question about Physics I'm doing at school.\n\nIf the speed of sound is inversely proportional to the density of a material, why does sound travel faster in solids (it is the most dense).\n\nI have read that it takes more energy for sound to travel in dense materials so it takes longer but then neighbouring molecules are closer so sound does not have to travel that far, making it faster. This doesn't make any sense because it says the more dense a medium is, sound is both faster and slower.\n\nAlso, how does bulk modulus affect the speed of sound.",
        "answer": "NOTE: THIS WAS EDITED TO ADD INTUITION(ESPECIALLY IN THE END OF THE ANSWER) \n\nThe speed of sound is proportional to the bulk modulus and inversely proportional to the density of the material. In most cases(or all, please correct me if somebody knows for sure), the bulk modulus in solids is much bigger when the solid has higher density. So, while the higher density tends to give you a smaller speed, the much larger bulk modulus gives a larger speed.  \n\nOr to rephrase, the difference in density is much lower in the difference in the bulk modulus for two materials, so the speed of sound gets bigger from the less dense to the more dense material. So, the compressibility factor wins over the density factor, and thus \"ruling\" over the final answer. \n\n\"I have read that it takes more energy for sound to travel in dense materials so it takes longer but then neighboring molecules are closer so sound does not have to travel that far, making it faster. This doesn't make any sense because it says the more dense a medium is, sound is both faster and slower.\"  \n\nThe power(the rate at which energy travels dE/dt) is given by the relation P=0.5\\*\u03c1\\*(\u03c9)^2\\*(\u03be)^2\\*\u0391\\*u  \n\nwhere \u03c1=density  \n\n\u03c9=angular frequency and its equal to 2\u03c0f  \n\n\u03be=displacement amplitude  \n\nA=cross section area of material in which wave travels through  \n\nu=the speed of propagation  \n\nNow, say we produce a sound of a given energy in air(and thus constant power if we don't include loss of energy in our analysis). When the sound reaches the solid material, then it starts to propagate within the solid(and not the air). Now, for a less dense material(we consider the same bulk modulus between the two materials so as to just see the effects that the density has on the speed of propagation), in a given volume you will have less mass than the denser material for the same volume. So, in order for the power to remain constant, for more mass per unit volume(which is the density) and the same bulk modulus we must get a lower speed(check the relation that I wrote above about the power). \n\nMore intuition:  \n\nDensity: The higher the density, the more mass you have in a given volume that tries to oscillate. But that also means that we have more inertial forces, so the material \"resists\" more, so the harder it is to accelerate the molecules in the volume.  \n\nBulk modulus: The bigger it is, the solid is not easily compressed. So, this means that when a force of given magnitude gets applied to that volume, the volume will not be easily compressed and so it will be accelerated more pushing the volume of the material that is next to it. For low bulk modulus, it is easily compressed and thus for that same force it will be compressed more and so move less, pushing the volume of the material next to it less. So, the bigger the bulk modulus, the more a volume pushes(or pulls) the volume next to it, thus giving us a wave of propagation that is bigger than that that we would get for a lower bulk modulus.",

So I'll have to pass the validation result and any error message back to the view for displaying in a balloonmessage.\n\nBy the way, if your wondering why I'm using a tooltip instead of wrapping `EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP` its because I wanted this functionallity on Windows 2000 and `EM_SHOWBALLOONTIP` was added in XP. Tooltip can be displayed as a balloon in 2000 as long as IE 5.5 or greater is installed (all my Win2K clients are using IE 6).

Supposedly this result can be used to derive a useful matrix formula for orthogonal projection, but I'm not sure how to figure out how we can show the equality above. Does $(T^\\ast T)^{-1}$ even make sense? How do we show that? And what is the intuition of the above formulation?\n\nAmong my ideas are trying to show that the right hand side is in the range of $T$ (which it seems to be) and trying to utilize the fact that $P\\_{Range T}^2 = P\\_{Range T}$. But I'm not sure how to proceed from there.",
        "answer": "First, note that if $T^{\\*}Tv = 0$ then\n\n$$ 0 = \\left< T^{\\*}Tv, v \\right> = \\left < Tv, Tv \\right> = \\| Tv \\|^2 = 0 $$\n\nso $Tv = 0$. Since $T$ is injective, it implies that $v = 0$. Hence, $T^{\\*}T \\colon V \\rightarrow V$ is invertible. Now,\n\n$$ P^2 = T(T^{\\*}T)^{-1}T^{\\*} T(T^{\\*}T)^{-1} T^{\\*} = T(T^{\\*}T)^{-1}T^{\\*} = P $$\n\nand\n\n$$ P^{\\*} = \\left( T(T^{\\*}T)^{-1}T^{\\*} \\right)^{\\*} = \\left( T^{\\*} \\right)^{\\*} \\left( (T^{\\*}T)^{-1} \\right)^{\\*} T^{\\*} = \\\\T \\left( (T^{\\*}T)^{\\*} \\right)^{-1} T^{\\*} = T \\left( T^{\\*} \\left (T^{\\*} \\right)^{\\*} \\right)^{-1} T^{\\*} = T(T^{\\*}T)^{-1}T^{\\*} = P$$\n\nso $P$ is self-adjoint. Hence, $P$ is an orthogonal projection onto $\\operatorname{Range}(P)$. Finally, since $T$ is injective, we have that $T^{\\*}$ is surjective and since $(T^{\\*}T)$ is an isomorphism we have\n\n$$ \\operatorname{Range}(P) = \\operatorname{Range}(T). $$\n\n---\n\nLet's see how you can arrive the formula intuitively. Since $P$ is an orthogonal projection on $\\operatorname{Range}(T)$, it should vanish on $\\operatorname{Range}(T)^{\\perp} = \\ker(T^{\\*})$ so it makes sense to look for $P$ of the form $P = AT^{\\*}$. You also want that the range of $P$ will be the range of $T$ so that it makes sense to look for $P$ of the form $P = TAT^{\\*}$ with $A \\colon V \\rightarrow V$ being an isomorphism. In order for $P$ to be a projection, we should have\n\n$$ P^2 = T(AT^{\\*}T)AT^{\\*} = TAT^{\\*} = P$$\n\nwhich will hold if $AT^{\\*}T = \\operatorname{id}|\\_{V}$ or $A = (T^{\\*}T)^{-1}$.",

        "question": "Let's say I have two or more processes dealing with an SQLite database - a \"player\" process and many \"editor\" processes. \n\nThe \"player\" process reads the database and updates a view - in my case it would be a waveform being mixed to the soundcard depending on events stored in the database.\n\nAn \"editor\" process is any editor for that database: it changes the database constantly.\n\nNow I want the player to reflect the editing changes quickly.\n\nI know that SQLite supplies hooks to trace database changes within the same process, but there seems to be little info on how to do this with multiple processes.\n\nI could poll the database constantly, compare records and trigger events, but that seems to be quite inefficient, especially when the database grows to a large size.\n\nI am thinking about using a log table and triggers, but I wonder if there is a simpler method.",
        "answer": "A relational database is not your best first choice for this.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou want all of your editors to pass changes to your player. \n\nYour player is -- effectively -- a server for all those editors. Your player needs multiple open connections. It must listen to all those connections for changes. It must display those changes.\n\nIf the changes are really large, you can move to a hybrid solution where the editors persist the changes *and* notify the player. \n\nEither way, the editors must notify they player that they have a change. It's much, much simpler than the player trying to discover changes in a database.\n\n---\n\nA better design is a server which accepts messages from the editors, persists them, and notifies the player. This server is neither editor nor player, but merely a broker that assures that all the messages are handled. It accepts connections from editors and players. It manages the database.\n\nThere are two implementations. Server IS the player. Server is separate from the player. The design of server doesn't change -- only the protocol. When server is the player, then server calls the player objects directly. When server is separate from the player, then the server writes to the player's socket.\n\nWhen the player is part of the server, player objects are invoked directly when a message is received from an editor. When the player is separate, a small reader collects the messages from a socket and calls the player objects.\n\nThe player connects to the server and then waits for a stream of information. This can either be input from the editors or references to data that the server persisted in the database.\n\nIf your message traffic is small enough so that network latency is not a problem, editor sends all the data to the server/player. If message traffic is too large, then the editor writes to a database and sends a message with just a database FK to the server/player. \n\n---\n\nPlease clarify \"If the editor crashes while notifying, the player is permanently messed up\" in your question.\n\nThis sounds like a poor design for the player service. It can't be \"permanently messed up\" unless it's not getting state from the various editors. If it's getting state from the editors (but attempting to mirror that state, for example) then you should consider a design where the player simply gets state from the editor and cannot get \"permanently messed up\".",

His sentence was reduced from life to 15 years \"after pressure from friends abroad, including South Africa's Nelson Mandela, former US President Jimmy Carter and former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\" The imprisonment of Obasanjo and others by the regime of Sani Abacha was condemned internationally.

His first stint was from 1976 to 1979 as a military ruler following the assassination of General [Murtala Mohammed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murtala_Mohammed). He voluntarily left office in 1979, handing over to the democratically elected [Shehu Shagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehu_Shagari).

        "question": "In our road we have a crab apple tree that has fruits but there have never been any small new trees rooting from the crab apples. Once, years ago, there were 3 crab apple trees within 100 yards but 2 of these were destroyed by some ignorant house owners. However in my 83 years of living within 50 yards of these three trees I have never seen any young new seedling trees. Some of the apples must have fallen onto the surrounding soil that is never disturbed. Will an apple tree grow if I deliberately plant some of the fruit from this one remaining tree?",
        "answer": "I don't really know for crab apples, but I can tell you my experience with germinating regular apples (not necessarily on purpose).\n\nAnyway, I've found that if the ground is bare (has no grass, weeds, or anything on it), and if I squash the fallen apples on the ground, the next year I tend to get a lot of apple tree seedlings growing. If there's a lawn or anything like that, I wouldn't count on it (we had a lawn for years with few if any trees ever germinating in it, but now that we don't have a lawn there anymore, they germinate like weeds, especially Northern Catalpa, Lombardy Poplar, and Siberian Elm, but also apple and maybe other stuff). Trees like to germinate in bare soil, in my experience (not just apple trees). I don't know that I ever had seedlings from apples that I didn't squish (but it's possible; we usually picked most of the non-squished ones up).\n\nAnyway, I didn't plant the apples at all. I just squished them flat on compact, almost clay-type soil.\n\nWe do get cold winters (which may or may not be necessary for germination).\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if grass needs to be absent for a number of years. It seems like the trees didn't start germinating in large numbers until we went a few years with no lawn.\n\nIf you're wondering why I would squish apples (and I'm not recommending people squish them), it's so they would decompose faster, and so the nutrients would go back into the soil. We've had a lot of apples drop before they were ripe, probably for various reasons (drought, no mulch, old tree, perhaps a lack of thinning, severe, chronic spider mite infestation, maybe disease, and maybe other stuff).\n\nI don't believe I've ever had seedlings grow from planting entire apples. I only recall burying apples once (but not to try to germinate them); none sprouted. Nevertheless, I probably buried them too deeply for germination, and in soil that dries out very easily (not much grows in there, other than catnip in the spring).\n\nYour crab apples probably don't have the genetics to breed true-to-type from seed, and they'll likely also be cross-pollinated, if they're like regular apples (if other apple or crab apple trees are near). But, you can certainly grow trees from seed, if they're like regular apples (I know they can pollinate regular apples).",

        "answer": "The canonical way to do code-behind in Flex is via inheritance. Here's a good explanation from the docs: <http://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/Flex/Code+Behind>. In a nutshell:\n\n1. Declare an ActionScript class to use as your base class.\n2. Set the base class as the root container in your MXML file.\n3. For any controls declared in your MXML file, you have to redeclare them as public members of the base class using the exact same name (exactly as you are doing above for your script block with source tag, only it works :-)\n\nSo, your ActionScript file:\n\n```\npackage mypackage\n{\n    import mx.controls.TextInput;\n\n    public class myClass extends WindowedApplication\n    {\n        public var marketInput:TextInput;\n\n        private function populateFromForm():void{\n            /* As above */\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd the corresponding MXML file:\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<custom:myClass xmlns:custom=\"mypackage.*\"\n        xmlns:fx=\"http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009\"\n        xmlns:s=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark\" \n        xmlns:mx=\"library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx\">\n    <mx:TextInput id=\"marketInput\"/>\n</custom:myClass>\n\n```\n\nEt cetera for your other TextInput controls. And now your populateFromForm function should work.\n\nIt is kind of heinous to have to redeclare the same entities twice, but it's not quite the bag of hurt the earlier respondent made it out to be (although it's possible this changed in Flex 4 to make it less painful than it was).",

        "question": "Suppose I have a multi-threaded application (say ~40 threads) running on a multiprocessor system (say 8 cores) with Linux as the operating system where different threads are more essentially LWP (Light Weight Processes) being scheduled by the kernel.\n\nWhat would be benefits/drawbacks of using the CPU affinity? Whether CPU affinity is going to help by localizing the threads to a subset of cores thus minimizing cache sharing/misses?",
        "answer": "If you use strict affinity, then a particular thread MUST run on that processor (or set of processors). If you have many threads that work completely independently, and they work on larger chunks of memory than a few kilobytes, then it's unlikely you'll benefit much from running on one particular core - since it's quite possible the other threads running on this particular CPU would have thrown out any L1 cache, and quite possibly L2 caches too. Which is more important for performance - cahce content or \"getting to run sooner\"? Are some CPU's always idle, or is the CPU load 100% on every core? \n\nHowever, only you know (until you tell us) what your threads are doing. How big is the \"working set\" (how much memory - code and data) are they touching each time they get to run? How long does each thread run when they are running? What is the interaction with other threads? Are other threads using shared data with \"this\" thread? How much and what is the pattern of sharing? \n\nFinally, the ultimate answer is \"What makes it run faster?\" - an answer you can only find by having good (realistic) benchmarks and trying the different possible options. Even if you give us every single line of code, running time measurements for each thread, etc, etc, we could only make more or less sophisticated guesses - until these have been tried and tested (with VARYING usage patterns), it's almost impossible to know. \n\nIn general, I'd suggest that having many threads either suggest that each thread isn't very busy (CPU-wise), or you are \"doing it wrong\"... More threads aren't better if they are all running flat out - better to have fewer threads in that case, because they are just going to fight each other.",

But, when I test `DO_BUS_ENUMERATED_DEVICE` flag (From msdn: *The operating system sets this flag in each physical device object (PDO).

Or some another explanation for this issue? When I get some `PDEVICE_OBJECT`, how can I know Is it PDO or FDO?\n\n2 - When the user plugs in some usb device, and the filter driver should handle `IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS`, how can I determine which device from Object array is just now plugged in device and which one was plugged in before, and which one is marked as inactive?\n\nThanks in advance.\nFelix.",

I want the object property of the radio button to change based on its state. The reason for doing this is because the value is tied to `answer.is_correct` in the model, which is a boolean that indicates which answer is correct. If the question being asked is true, then the correct option should be True. But if the question being asked is false, then the correct option should be False.\n\nAs such, my requirements are:\n\n1. If the True radio button is selected:\n\n\t* `answer.is_correct` should be **true** for True radio button\n\t* `answer.is_correct` should be **false** for False radio button\n2. If the False radio button is selected:\n\n\t* `answer.is_correct` should be **false** for True radio button\n\t* `answer.is_correct` should be **true** for the False radio button\n\nHere is a snippet of the current code, which is incorrect because if the user goes back to edit a previously created question (the form for creating and editing a question uses the same view), changing the correct answer from True to False does not set `answer.is_correct` to false for the True option.

        "answer": "* The comment `start index at 1; not 0` is not helpful; that part of the code is pretty self-explanatory. Rather, you could comment on your reasoning for doing so.\n* The spacing in `indexOfElem` is horrendous. Please space out your braces properly. If they enclose only one line, you lose the protection against adding code that you think is in the loop, but in reality is not.\n* The use of a `while` loop in `indexOfElem` is alright, but you may find the `for` loop variant more natural. You'll notice that we no longer need to assign `index` to 1, since our loop (which admittedly uses an additional iteration) will take care of it for us.\n\n```\nfunction indexOfElem(elem) {\n    var index = 0;\n    for (var target = elem.nodeType; elem; elem = elem.previousSibling) {\n        if (elem.nodeType === target) {\n            index++;\n        }\n    }\n    return index;\n}\n\n```\n* The `if (no.parentNode)` block in `selectTab` works, but it's kind of icky. It isn't immediately clear that when called with a DOM element, the DOM element will be a direct child of the tab itself. Rather, you can do a more natural check for `typeof no`, and set the `onclick` for the `<a>` to `selectTab(this.parentNode)`.\n* In `selectTab`, I'd prefer to write the assignment in the `if` condition. I'd also rather group together the select and deselect code, rather than grouping together the `li` and `div` code.\n* Right now, if I `selectTab(-1)`, my tab will be unselected. Instead, it seems like it would be better to check if the index is in bounds first. **This is a behavioural change; it's up to you whether you keep it.**\n* You use `elem` in `indexOfElem`, so why use `e` here? For consistency, rename `e` to `elem`. I also renamed `no` to `index`.\n\n```\nfunction selectTab(index) {\n    if (typeof index !== \"number\") {\n        index = indexOfElem(index);\n    }\n    var max = Math.min(\n        document.querySelectorAll(\".tabs > div\").length,\n        document.querySelectorAll(\".tabs > ul > li\").length\n    );\n    if (index < 1 || index > max) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // deselect the currently selected tab, if applicable\n    // this code could be moved into a separate removeClass function, but it's only used twice here so it's not *that* bad...\n    var elem;\n    if (elem = document.querySelector(\".tabs > ul > li.selected\")) {\n        elem.classList.remove(\"selected\");\n    }\n    if (elem = document.querySelector(\".tabs > div.selected\")) {\n        elem.classList.remove(\"selected\");\n    }\n\n    // select the new tab. no checking required since we already did a range check\n    document.querySelector(\".tabs > ul > li:nth-of-type(\" + index + \")\").classList.add(\"selected\");\n    document.querySelector(\".tabs > div:nth-of-type(\" + index + \")\").classList.add(\"selected\");\n}\n\n```\n* In `windowOnloadPush`, you should return early if `newOnload` isn't executable. As a matter of style I prefer `x && x()`, but that's your choice.\n\n```\nfunction windowOnloadPush(newOnload) {\n    if (typeof newOnload !== \"function\") {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    var currentOnload = window.onload;\n    window.onload = function() {\n        currentOnload && currentOnload();\n        newOnload();\n    };\n}\n\n```\n* In `loadTabs`, if you make the first change to `selectTab` that I mentioned, you'll need to change to `onclick.value = \"selectTab(this.parentNode);\";`.\n* Right now you're reassigning all the children of the tab to the `<a>`. That's fine, but if you're just trying to set the text, you can use `textContent` instead. **Again, this is a behavioural change.**\n\n```\nfunction loadTabs() {\n    var elems = document.querySelectorAll(\".tabs > ul > li\");\n    for (var i = 0; i < elems.length; i++) {\n        var a = document.createElement('a');\n        var href = document.createAttribute('href');\n        href.value = \"#\";\n        var onclick = document.createAttribute('onclick');\n        onclick.value = \"selectTab(this.parentNode);\";\n\n        a.setAttributeNode(href);\n        a.setAttributeNode(onclick);\n\n        a.textContent = elems[i].textContent;\n        elems[i].textContent = \"\";\n\n        elems[i].appendChild(a);\n    }\n    selectTab(1);\n}\n\n```\n* You don't need to use `function() { loadTabs() }`; just use `loadTabs`:\n\n```\nwindowOnloadPush(loadTabs);\n\n```\n* Minor stylistic point about your CSS: you can use `0` instead of `0px` or `#888` instead of `#888888`. These aren't big deals though, and it's perfectly fine to leave them as-is.\n* You've got `padding: 1em` on `a` in your CSS. This means that there's some extra click space for each tab \u2014 clicking on the top of the content changes the tab, which is unintuitive. Instead, use `padding: 0 1em;`. (If you like units, you can use `padding: 0em 1em;`. DON'T use `padding: 0px 1em;` because, well, why would you?)\n* You're duplicating `display: inline;` on `.tabs > ul > li.selected`. You can safely remove this.\n* Rather than setting `display: none;` on `.tabs > div` and `display: block` on `.tabs > div.selected`, you can just set `display: none;` on `.tabs > div:not(.selected)`. It's up to you to decide which reads better, though I should note that this approach is probably ever so slightly less performant.\n* It would be nice if the `<ul>` was auto-generated. You could set a `data-name` or `data-title` or something on each `<div>` and then create the `<ul>` in `loadTabs()`. I didn't implement this, but you should think about it.\n\n[Here's a fiddle with my revised code.](http://jsfiddle.net/gqL1ze52/)",

This question also refers to an everyday/street situation, not a controlled bout, and assumes the opponent is bigger/heavier.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wSpwP.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wSpwP.jpg)\n\nFirstly, [this is an example of a shoulder charge](https://youtu.be/C82M30_9ulE?t=12), it's called the same in soccer and a \"shoulder check\" in hockey (except you're on skates of course). Essentially running towards an opponent but instead of tackling/doing a take down you put your weight into your shoulder and charge through them hoping to knock them over with your superior momentum.\n\nThe two main ways I would imagine this can come about is (a) someone takes a berserker running start at you from across the room, or (b) it is done from face to face or a few steps away, as more of a \"shoulder shove\".\n\nLooking forward to suggestions.",
        "answer": "Shoulder charging someone is a very basic way to attack. The attacker is committing their weight forward, and simply not being there is probably sufficient for them to put themselves on the ground. Move your feet and get out of the way.\n\n* The main difficulty is timing and speed. You need to move late enough that the charger is not able to readjust, but not so late that they hit you.\n* You probably don't have the time to grab anything with your hands but can push or wrap with your arms.\n* You should prefer to stay on your feet because it gives you more flexibility for what may happen next.\n* I don't think it really matters whether you evade to the front or rear because the charger is already committed; you won't be getting the second punch from a combination by moving to the front.\n* You can add a trip. In judo this would be a sasae tsurikomi ashi, but it won't look like most examples because judo players don't normally unbalance themselves for you. Normally you would have to get grips and unbalance them yourself.",

You could alter `MyEventArgs` to have as many `Properties` as you like which could be `set` via a number of `TextBox` controls on `Form2` where a `Button` control is pressed should you desire.",

        "answer": "Short answer: you won't get a \"fool-proof\" solution; i.e. a solution that someone can't subvert.\n\nUnless you are running your library on a JVM platfrom that you control, users of your library will be able to find a way to subvert your \"only once per thread\" restriction if they try hard enough. For example:\n\n* They could use reflection to access the private state of the objects or classes that implement the restriction.\n* They could use bytecode injection to subvert your code.\n* They could decompile and replacing your code.\n* They could modify their JVM to do something funky with your code. (The OpenJDK source code is available to anyone.)\n\nAsk yourself the following:\n\n* Is this restriction reasonable from the perspective of the programmer you are trying to restrict?\n* Would a sensible programmer have good reason to try to break it?\n* Have you considered possible use-cases for your library where it would be reasonable to call `createTask()` multiple times? For example, use-cases that involve using thread pools?\n\nIf you are doing this because you think allowing multiple `createTask()` calls will break your library, my advice would be:\n\n* Tell the programmer via the javadocs and other documentation what is likely to break if they do the thing that you are trying to prevent.\n* Implement a \"soft\" check, and provide an easy way for a programmer to disable the check. (But do the check by default, if you think that is appropriate.)\n\nThe point is that a sensible programmer won't knowingly subvert restrictions unless they have good reason to. If they do, and they hurt themselves, that is not your problem.\n\nOn the other hand, you are implementing this restriction for \"business reasons\" or to stop \"cheating\" or something like that, my advice would be to recognize that a determined user will be able to subvert *any* restrictions you attempt to embed in your code when they run it on their platform. If this fundamentally breaks your model, look for a different model.",

I also use FastMM to make sure my applications never leaks memory.\n\nThe application compares all these files with each other to find similarities. Over-simplified we can say that we compare text strings but the algorithm is way more complex as I have to allow some differences between strings. Each file is about 300KB.

These pages might be swapped back in when the heap memory walks the heap, to get swapped out again by windows. \n\nBecause you have a lot of RAM, the swapped out pages will stay in physical memory, as nobody else needs them.

So I whipped out a calculator and confirmed that this is indeed correct. And I could see, after some fooling around with pen and paper that any function in the form\n\\begin{align}\nk \\; \\left(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right)^k\n\\end{align}\nwhere $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ is bound to fall below one and stay there. So it's not a given that any function in the above form will be greater than one.\n\nWhat I'm actually curious about is **whether there are nifty or simple little tricks or calculations you can do in your head or any handwavy type arguments that you can make** to confirm that $$8\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^8 > 1$$ and even more generally, to confirm for certain natural numbers $k,n$ whether\n\\begin{align}\nk \\; \\left(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right)^k > 1\n\\end{align}\n\nSo are there? And if there are, what are they? \n\nIt can be geometrical. It can use arguments based on loose bounds of certain log values. It doesn't even have to be particularly simple as long as it is something you can do in your head and it is something you can explain reasonably clearly so that others can do also it (so if you're able to mentally calculate numbers like Euler, it's not useful for me).\n\nYou can safely assume that I have difficulties multiplying anything greater two single digit integers in my head. But I do also know that $$\\limsup\\_{k\\rightarrow \\infty} \\log(k) - a\\cdot k < 0$$ for any $a>0$ without having to go back to a textbook.",
        "answer": "Note that $(1-0.1)^8\\geq 1-0.8$ by [Bernoulli's inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_inequality), as mentioned in a comment by lvb. For other cases you can use $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n+1}\\right)^k\\geq 1-\\frac{k}{n+1}$, which makes it easier to find a sufficient condition on $n$ for $k\\left(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right)^k$ to be larger than $1$.\n\nIn the motivating problem, the idea was that $k$ is fixed (at $8$), and since $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ goes to $1$ as $n$ goes to infinity, $k\\left(\\frac{n}{n+1}\\right)^k$ approaches $k$, and in particular is eventually bigger than $1$. One then finds out in a particular case what \"eventually\" means; here $n=9$ suffices. In general, Bernoulli's inequality leads to the conclusion that $n>k$ suffices.",

This mechanism works. Another part of the application can receive the options from said device and stores them as one word into property **options**.

        "question": "[Cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) are energetic particles coming from space that hit the Earth's atmosphere and produce a lot of [secondary radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_shower_(physics)) (some of which we see in visible light as aurorae). Would it make sense for an organism floating in the upper atmosphere, or even on the brink of space, to try and make this energy work for them, as plants do using the photons from sunlight to split water? Or are cosmic rays too destructive, or too unwieldy, or too sparse for such use? The question is not confined to Earth, of course, or to organisms similar to those living on today's Earth. I'm trying to decide if a microbial biosphere could live off cosmic radiation and its subproducts.\n\nP.S.: [This post](https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/36534/no-sunlight-just-high-energy-radiation) touches on some of the same points as my question, though I'm thinking more about a rogue planet far from any star-like energy source (i. e. no pulsars or black holes nearby).",
        "answer": "I would say that yes, it's borderline possible.\n\nThe organism should be very resistant to ionizing radiation; a Universe that allows [*Deinococcus radiodurans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans) to exist would have little trouble in producing this new critter, even limiting ourselves to DNA.\n\nThe organism would of course need to consume ordinary matter to replicate; it would therefore find it way more convenient to (also) extract what energy it can from that matter. Actually it's likely that the capability of absorbing cosmic radiation would evolve from the former; the organism acquires matter and this interacts with cosmic radiation, supplying harvestable energy. Once this kind of matter is more and more incorporated into the new generations of the organism, it will \"optimize\" itself to directly take advantage of the radiation.\n\nAn organism could not begin directly using cosmic radiation, since to do that it would need chemicals and structures that would be already pretty complex. It would need to start from simple chemical reactions, and evolve to first defend against, then make use of the radiation. The most obvious evolution pressure line would be if the defense takes the form of some radiation-hardy chemical, which is transformed on impact generating much higher-energy compounds that would be initially disposed of. Afterwards, any mutation allowing to extract energy from such compounds would have an enormous evolutionary value.\n\nThis is not unlike what already happened to [radiotrophic fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotrophic_fungus), which produce a special kind of melanin that is capable of harvesting energy from gamma radiations. It would be more difficult (!) for our hypothetic organism, in that cosmic rays are much more penetrating and energetic than gamma rays and therefore require proportionally more massive interception.\n\nAnd, of course, the organism would need to live somewhere with *a lot* of cosmic rays.\n\nOne possibility would be some sort of low-temperature outer space slug capable of accreting a \"black ice\" carapace. It would migrate to the safe center of cometary nuclei to spawn, then come out when the carapace is thick enough to both defend the young slug and supply it with energy. The slug would need to have a very low metabolic rate, and be based on a totally different organic chemistry than Earth organisms.\n\n---\n\nThere's something along these lines in [\"Camelot 30K\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot_30K) by physicist Robert L. Forward, where a (macroscopic) lifeform is presented that harvests atomic nuclei transmuted by the impact of cosmic rays on distant comets.\n\n> \n> *\"The initial energy source for the kerac civilization comes from the background cosmic radiation, which creates long-lived excited molecules and free radicals in the ice over long periods of time\"*. He drew an arrow leading to another box that he drew in the rotund shape of an iceworm. *\"Out on the farms, the iceworms and young heullers tunnel through the untouched ice around the periphery of Camalor. They extract free radicals frozen into the pristine ice and use them as a source of energy to grow and continue tunneling. Those long-lived free radicals are the first level energy source of the kerack food chain, since the iceworms and heullers are harvested as meat. While the iceworms are doing that, they also extract from the dirty ice all the unstable radioisotopes that the dirt and ice contain.\"*\n> \n> \n> \n\n(While different organisms are named - *iceworms*, *heullers*, *keracks* - it is posited in the book that they are actually all alternate phenotypes of a *single* organism, the kerack hive drone, not unlike what happens with bees).",

Most Chinese speakers would understand what you mean if you use it to mean \"quite.\"\n\nHowever, it should be noted that it is colloquial--it shows up in spoken Chinese but rarely in print, hence your discovery of it on a Chinese TV show. In fact, some native Chinese speakers will confuse \u86ee with \u6ee1 when asked to write the word down.",

My first approach was that, when a user clicked a bloc, its parameter panel would appear in the main window, to the right of the grid, reducing the grid's width.

I can move them around, hide them (by clicking on the red cross, or clicking elsewhere on the grid), and when I click the bloc again they appear at the same position on the screen as I left them, which is cool.\n\nThe only problem really is that the first time a bloc is clicked, its windows appear on top of each other, in the top left corner of the screen.

        "question": "My application calls some functions which are placed in an external static library. I link the external static library to my application and everything works (in this case I'm using GCC).\n\nNevertheless, the locations (addresses) of text, .data and .bss sections of the library are chosen by the linker. I can choose/change their locations by modifying the linker script, but it's tedious as I have to specify all the functions, variables, etc. of the library. What I mean it's something like:\n\n```\n. = 0x1000; /* new location */\nKEEP(*(.text.library_function1));\nKEEP(*(.text.library_function2));\n[...]\n\n```\n\nAn alternative solution is to build the external library by placing a *section attribute* for each function/variable, and then modifying the linker by re-locating the whole section. Something like:\n\n```\n/* C source file */\nunsigned char __attribute__((section (\".myLibrarySection\"))) variable1[10];\nunsigned char __attribute__((section (\".myLibrarySection\"))) variable2[10];\n\n/* Linker script */\n. = 0x1000;\nKEEP(*(.myLibrarySection))\n\n```\n\nHowever, I'd like to be able to relocate entire .text, .data and .bss segments of an external static library without the need of using these tricks.\n\nI'd like something like this (in linker script):\n\n```\n. = 0x1000;\nKEEP(*(.text.library_file_name))\n\n```\n\nIs it possible using GCC toolchain?\n\nIs it possible using other toolchains (IAR, Keil, etc.)?",
        "answer": "You can use the [`archive:filename`](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Input-Section-Basics.html) syntax in ld.\n\nFirst place all the `.o` files from your external library into a static library `.a` file, if they aren't already. That is the normal way static library binaries are distributed.\n\nThen in the linker script, specify:\n\n```\n.text.special : {\n    . = 0x1000;\n    *libspecial.a:*(.text .text.*)\n}\n\n.text {\n    *(.text .text.*)\n}\n\n```\n\nThe wildcard will pick all the files coming from `libspecial.a` and place them in the first section. The later wildcard will then pick anything left over. If there is a need to place the `.text.special` section after the normal section, you can use `EXCLUDE_FILE` directive in a similar way.",

        "answer": "GROUP BY summarizes data by aggregating a group of rows, returning *one* row per group. You're using the aggregate function `max()`, which will return the *maximum* value from one column for a group of rows. \n\nLet's look at some data. I renamed the column you called \"date\".\n\n```\ncreate table sales (\n  customerId integer not null,\n  saleId integer not null,\n  saledate date not null\n  );\n\ninsert into sales values\n(1, 10, '2013-05-13'),\n(1, 11, '2013-05-14'),\n(1, 12, '2013-05-14'),\n(1, 13, '2013-05-17'),\n(2, 20, '2013-05-11'),\n(2, 21, '2013-05-16'),\n(2, 31, '2013-05-17'),\n(2, 32, '2013-03-01'),\n(3, 33, '2013-05-14'),\n(3, 35, '2013-05-14');\n\n```\n\nYou said\n\n> \n> In another words, the first 2 lines are from the same customer(id 19), i wish he'd get only one record for each client, which would be the record with the max date, in the case, the second record from this list. \n> \n> \n> \n\n```\nselect s.customerId, max (s.saledate) \nfrom sales s\nwhere s.saledate <= '2013-05-16'\ngroup by s.customerId\norder by customerId;\n\ncustomerId  max\n--\n1           2013-05-14 \n2           2013-05-16\n3           2013-05-14\n\n```\n\nWhat does that table mean? It means that the latest date on or before May 16 on which customer \"1\" bought something was May 14; the latest date on or before May 16 on which customer \"2\" bought something was May 16. If you use this derived table in joins, it will return predictable results *with consistent meaning*.\n\nNow let's look at a slightly different query. MySQL permits this syntax, and returns the result set below.\n\n```\nselect s.customerId, s.saleId, max(s.saledate) max_sale\nfrom sales s\nwhere s.saledate <= '2013-05-16'\ngroup by s.customerId\norder by customerId;\n\ncustomerId  saleId  max_sale\n--\n1           10      2013-05-14\n2           20      2013-05-16\n3           33      2013-05-14\n\n```\n\nThe sale with ID \"10\" didn't happen on May 14; it happened on May 13. This query has produced a falsehood. Joining this derived table with the table of sales transactions will compound the error.\n\nThat's why Firebird correctly raises an error. The solution is to drop saleId from the SELECT clause.\n\nNow, having said all that, you can find the customers who have had no sales since May 16 like this.\n\n```\nselect distinct customerId from sales\nwhere customerID not in\n  (select customerId\n  from sales\n  where saledate >= '2013-05-16')\n\n```\n\nAnd you can get the right customerId and the \"right\" saleId like this. (I say \"right\" saleId, because there could be more than one on the day in question. I just chose the max.)\n\n```\nselect sales.customerId, sales.saledate, max(saleId)\nfrom sales\ninner join (select customerId, max(saledate) max_date\n            from sales\n            where saledate < '2013-05-16'\n            group by customerId) max_dates\n        on sales.customerId = max_dates.customerId\n        and sales.saledate = max_dates.max_date\ninner join (select distinct customerId \n            from sales\n            where customerID not in\n              (select customerId\n               from sales\n               where saledate >= '2013-05-16')) no_sales\n        on sales.customerId = no_sales.customerId\ngroup by sales.customerId, sales.saledate\n\n```\n\nPersonally, I find common table expressions make it easier for me to read SQL statements like that without getting lost in the SELECTs.\n\n```\nwith no_sales as (\n  select distinct customerId \n  from sales\n  where customerID not in\n    (select customerId\n     from sales\n     where saledate >= '2013-05-16')\n),\nmax_dates as (\n  select customerId, max(saledate) max_date\n  from sales\n  where saledate < '2013-05-16'\n  group by customerId\n)\nselect sales.customerId, sales.saledate, max(saleId)\nfrom sales\ninner join max_dates\n        on sales.customerId = max_dates.customerId\n        and sales.saledate = max_dates.max_date\ninner join no_sales\n        on sales.customerId = no_sales.customerId\ngroup by sales.customerId, sales.saledate\n\n```",

I'd like to play wizard, but right as I'm about to become useful the campaign fizzles out. \n\nAt low levels I feel like I'm more of a hindrance than a help. I fire a magic missile or two, then shoot a light crossbow or something and die in one or two hits from just about anything. At level three, second level spells help the situation a lot, but levels one and two in particular are quite brutal.\n\nHow can I build my wizard in such a way that he's useful in combat at all levels, not just once he can cast fireball?

You should be doing things other than casting *magic missile*.\n\n*Magic missile* itself is kind of a trap. It does low damage at low levels at the cost of your precious level 1 spell slots. For a slight decrease in damage, you can prep a damage dealing cantrip which you can cast an unlimited number of times. (Generally, I tend to skip prepping any direct damage spells unless I think my wizards might be alone part of the day or I think I will need it to bypass DR.)\n\nThings you should be casting beside *magic missile*:\n\n**Cantrips**:\n*acid splash*, *ray of frost*, *daze*, *disrupt undead*, *detect magic*, *prestidigitation*\n\n**Level 1 spells**:\n*grease*, *sleep*, *color spray*, *obscuring mist*",

What you are doing afterwards is appending the *options* to the `<div id=\"#date\"/>` rather than the `<select>` that was appended. I don't think the final closing `</select>` will actually do anything either.\n\nIf you really want to use append the following JavaScript will add the options to the correct node:\n\n```\n// dummy data object for example\nvar data = new Array(new Array(), new Array());\ndata[0].date_time = 2011;\ndata[1].date_time = 2012;\n\nvar options = new Array();\n$.each(data, function(index, option) {\n    options.push('<option value=\"' + index + '\">'+ option.date_time +'</option>');\n});\n\n$('<select id=\"date\"/>').append(options.join('')).appendTo('#date');\n\n```\n\nAssuming the existing HTML:\n\n```\n<div id=\"date\"></div>\n\n```\n\nHowever this does incur an overhead since appending is occurring twice.

        "answer": "In C-inspired languages, `<<` and `>>` operators are left and right [bitwise shift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Shifts_in_C.2C_C.2B.2B.2C_C.23) operators (though in C++ they can be overloaded \u2014 the most famous overload is probably [I/O stream operators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_%28C++%29)). For example,\n\n```\nx = y << 2;\n\n```\n\nassigns x the result of shifting y to the left by two bits.\n\nUsually you will see a lot of byte shifting in low-level code and here is why... Any hardware provides a way to configure and control its behavior but nobody wants to use the whole integer to represent, say, ON/OFF state. Therefore, hardware developers generally provide a single integer (aka a register, most often unsigned 32-bit) and state that, for example, bit #0 enables or disables data transmission, bit #1 enables or disables data filtering, bit #3 does some other magic and so one and so force. Generally, one or more settings can be read or changed at the same time. Now imagine how convenient that is for software developers \u2014 instead of working with simple integers (or booleans), programmers have to deal with bits that are generally not addressable by the CPU. To simplify their lives, developers define masks. Sticking with the above example, the configuration masks could look like this:\n\n```\n#define MYDEV_ENABLE_DATA_FLOW (1u<<0)\n#define MYDEV_ENABLE_FILTERING (1u<<1)\n#define MYDEV_ENABLE_MAGIC     (1u<<2)\n\n```\n\nSince the right hand side of the shift expression is known, compiler will generate the following integers for each value respectively:\n\n* 1\n* 2\n* 4\n\nWhich at first might not make a lot of sense, but if you look at those values in binary representation, the look like this:\n\n* 0b001\n* 0b010\n* 0b100\n\nIn other words, each value has only one bit set at different positions. Then, say we want to enable data transmission and a magic functionality but not enable filtering for our imaginary device. For that, we would have to have only bits #0 and #2 set (`1`), and bit #1 unset (`0`). This is when [Bitwise OR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) operator along with our pre-defined masks come handy. What we do is this:\n\n```\nuint32_t value_for_device = MYDEV_ENABLE_DATA_FLOW | MYDEV_ENABLE_MAGIC;\n\n```\n\nWhich \"OR\"s `0b001` and `0b100`, giving `0b101` value. We send this to a device, it checks every bit and enables or disables corresponding functionality.\n\nOther bits operations are often used as well. Say, we don't know what is currently enabled or disabled, and we don't want to change anything but just make sure that data filtering is off. This can be done by reading the current configuration, un-setting the bit, and writing it back. For example:\n\n```\nuint32_t value;\nvalue = read_from_device();\nvalue &= (~MYDEV_ENABLE_FILTERING);\nwrite_to_device(value);\n\n```\n\nThis is, of course, not the only usage. For a lot of useful examples, see [\"Bit Twiddling Hacks\" by Sean Eron Anderson](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html).\n\nOK, getting back to your original question \u2014 why write `(1<<0)` and not simply `(1)`? There are a number of reasons:\n\nConsistency\n-----------\n\nIt is more consistent to have something like this:\n\n```\n#define A (1<<0)\n#define B (1<<1)\n#define C (1<<2)\n\n```\n\nRather than this:\n\n```\n#define A (1)\n#define B (1<<1)\n#define C (1<<2)\n\n```\n\nOr even this:\n\n```\n#define A 1\n#define B 2\n#define C 4\n\n```\n\nMaintainability\n---------------\n\n### Easy to change things around\n\nIt makes it easier to change things around. It is easier to change things around by only changing the shift width and not keep adding/removing '<\n\n### Expression of intent\n\nIt clearly states the intent of the author to those who read the code. Just `1` does not mean much. But when you see `1<<0` you most likely assume that bit shifting is involved and the code works with bit-masks.\n\nFlexibility\n-----------\n\nImagine that the number by which the shift should be performed is defined as a macro. For example:\n\n```\n#define MY_BIT (1u<<MAGIC_BIT_OFFSET)\n\n```\n\nThen, you don't really know wether the result is `1` or not. And you can keep bit offset definitions separately.\n\nThere is probably some more reasons to do this that don't come to my mind straight away.\n\nHope it clears up things a *bit*. Good Luck!",

        "question": "While playing around with Mathematica I noticed that most polynomials with real coefficients seem to have most complex zeroes very near the unit circle. For instance, if we plot all the roots of a polynomial of degree 300 with coefficients chosen randomly from the interval $[27, 42]$, we get something like this:\n\n![roots](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wyg89.png)\n\nThe Mathematica code to produce the picture was:\n\n```\nrandomPoly[n_, x_, {a_, b_}] := \n  x^Range[0, n] . Table[RandomReal[{a, b}], {n + 1}];\nGraphics[Point[{Re[x], Im[x]}] /. \n  NSolve[randomPoly[300, x, {27, 42}], x], Axes -> True]\n\n```\n\nIf I try other intervals and other degrees, the picture is always mostly the same: almost all roots are close to the unit circle.\n\n**Question: why does this happen?**",

I have two examples of proven asymptotics of the zeros.\n\n* Let $\\theta$ be a Pisot number, with minimal polynomial $P\\in{\\mathbb Z}[X]$.

Define $P\\_n(X)=X^nP(X)-A(X)\\in{\\mathbb Z}[X]$. This polynomial has only one root $\\theta\\_n$ of modulus $\\ge1$ ; it is again a Pisot number, whose limit is $\\theta$. The other roots of $P\\_n$ tend to $\\mathbb T$ and the empirical measure tends to the uniform measure of the unit circle.\n* In 1992, I considered the (deterministic) sequence of polynomials\n$$q\\_r(X)=\\prod\\_{j=0}^{r-1}(X+1+\\frac{j}r)-\\prod\\_{j=0}^{r-1}(1+\\frac{j}r)$$\nI proved that the roots concentrate, as $r\\rightarrow+\\infty$, along the transcendental curve $\\Gamma$ of equation\n$$\\left|\\frac{(z+2)^{z+2}}{(z+1)^{z+1}}\\right|=4.$$\nThe distribution density is $\\frac1{2\\pi}\\rho(s)ds$ where $s\\mapsto\\gamma(s)$ is the arc-length parametrization of $\\Gamma$ and\n$$\\rho(s)=\\Im\\left(\\gamma'(s)\\log\\frac{\\gamma(s)+2}{\\gamma(s)+1}\\right)+\\frac{\\partial(P\\circ\\gamma)}{\\partial s}\\,$$\nand $P$ is the solution of the non-homogeneous Neumann problem $\\Delta P=0$ inside $\\Gamma$ with \n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial\\nu}=\\Re\\left(\\gamma'(s)\\log\\frac{\\gamma(s)+2}{\\gamma(s)+1}\\right).$$\nNotice that $\\Gamma$ is quite close to a circle, although it is not exactly one.",

Tap an area of the screen\n2. `UIImagePickerController` displays\n3. Select a photo\n4. Photo displays in the tapped area of the screen\n\nI would like it so that if the user goes through this workflow for a second time, the `UIImagePickerController` when displayed will be showing the same album, and position within that album, that the user was last at.\n\nI've tried saving a reference to the `UIImagePickerController`, as well as the `UIPopoverController`, so that they are created only once. However, every time I present the popover containing the `UIImagePickerController`, it is back at the main photos menu (eg. Camera Roll, Photo Library, My Photo Stream).\n\nAny ideas for how to achieve what I'm after?",
        "answer": "Just to point you to right direction. You can use asset library to show the images as a picker. You can use the apple sample code [MyImagePicker](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/MyImagePicker/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010135). The method `[[assetsLibrary] enumerateGroupsWithTypes:ALAssetsGroupAlbum usingBlock:^(ALAssetsGroup *group, BOOL *stop)` can be used for photo album. Using the asset library you can check which image was selected last and then use the method,\n\n```\n- (void)enumerateAssetsAtIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)indexSet options:(NSEnumerationOptions)options usingBlock:(ALAssetsGroupEnumerationResultsBlock)enumerationBlock;\n\n```\n\nYou can use this method next time to enumerate which image onwards you want to enumerate. This method can accept an indexSet as `[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndexesInRange:NSMakeRange(index, count)]` which should help to indicate the last selected image.\n\nTo know more about [how to use asset library check this](http://www.fiveminutes.eu/accessing-photo-library-using-assets-library-framework-on-iphone/).",

If we do send it directly, why we can not send the square-wave signal directly into the air wireless channel? What is the reason behind? Is it because the cable or wire are more stable but wireless is very unstable?",
        "answer": "The physics of antennas plays a large part. To understand this, you must consider the Fourier transform of your signal. For a simple binary NRZ code, where 0 is 0V and 1 is some voltage, Most of the Fourier energy is contained within the frequency range 0-B/2, where B is your bitrate. But antennas are frequency-selective: at the high end, an efficient non-directional antenna has an effective signal collecting area that declines as the square of frequency. At the low end, efficiency suffers if the antenna is much less than a wavelength in dimension. The entire story is much more complicated than above, but any attempt to ameliorate the frequency dependence in some parameters increases the frequency dependence in other parameters. However, an antenna where the ratio of the highest to lowest frequency of operation is small can have nearly constant parameters over that narrow frequency range. Unfortunately, the NRZ signal has a **infinite** ratio, since the lowest frequency is zero! Any attempt to send a NRZ signal directly through a pair of antennas will yield an extremely distorted signal.\n\nThe usual cure is to modulate a wave that has a frequency, f, that is at least several times your bitrate. This moves the Fourier energy up to a band, perhaps f\u00b1B/2, with a small ratio of highest to lowest frequency. Then, antennas are well behaved, and you may recover the received data with a demodulator.",

        "question": "Is there a simple method to do a sanity check on a **bipolar junction transistor** whether it is still functional or defective?\n\n![schematic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/i7pHZ.png)\n\n[simulate this circuit](/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fi7pHZ.png) \u2013 Schematic created using [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/)\n\nSay for example I have a circuit that used to function, and I suspect the transistor (NPN, PNP). How would I go forward to make sure the transistor is defective or how can I reasonably be sure it isn't? Do I need the datasheet for the part?",
        "answer": "I check BJT's and diode's with the BJT and diode testing receptacles on my multimeter. It will report the forward drop for diodes, and the DC gain (HFE) for BJT's, both PNP and NPN. It is easy to insert TO-220 and TO-92 packaged transistors into the receptacles, which are spaced at 0.1\". Each receptacle has four holes: EBCE, so that it can accomodate transistor pinouts that have the base in the middle, or the collector in the middle.\n\nIf you don't have this feature in your meter you should get one that has it! Or else you have to build a test jig, perhaps on a breadboard or more permanently.\n\nThere are simple tests you can do for obvious failures like opens and shorts. You should be able to make a simple circuit using a voltage source and a resistor, where the base diode (VBE) is used as a diode. Current should flow and the VBE drop should be a reasonable figure like 0.6-0.7V. Another test: the collector should not be shorted to the emitter. \n\nIf a transistor is in a circuit and cannot be removed, then one thing to do is to find another instance of exactly the same device and compare measurements. Failing that, if the transistor is part of a repeated circuit (e.g. channel in an audio device) or part of a complementary pair arrangement (where the voltages and currents in both halves should be similar), that can provide clues that the transistor isn't working. Failing that, what we can do is understand the circuit and use that to our advantage. We can directly measure the node voltages at the transistor's terminals when the circuit is powered up. Currents can be estimated by measuring voltage drops across the resistors (assuming the resistors are themselves not faulty and we know their values).",

I'm using Firefox 43.0.2 on Windows.\n\nI noticed something interesting when I visited the site [Origin Energy site](https://online.originenergy.com.au): <https://online.originenergy.com.au>.\n\nThe site's (leaf) certificate uses the SHA-2/SHA-256 signature algorithm. See certificate details dialog screenshot.\n[![Certificate details dialog](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YYz74.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YYz74.png)\n\nWhere as the connection cipher suite appears to use SHA-1.

Are the Certificate Signature Algorithm and signature algorithm in the negotiated connection cipher suite used for different purposes?\n\nIf these signature algorithms are used for different purposes.\n\nQ2. Does the upcoming sunset for SHA-1 relate to the Certificate Signature Algorithm and signature algorithm in the connection cipher suite?\n\nand\n\nQ3. The [SSL Labs scan](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=online.originenergy.com.au) for the site shows the web service cipher suite lists supports SHA-2 and SHA-1 algorithms.\n\nIf I'm using the latest version of Firefox why does the server/client negotiation not use the preferred SHA-2 algorithm for the connection?",
        "answer": "> \n> Are the Certificate Signature Algorithm and signature algorithm in the\n> negotiated connection cipher suite used for different purposes?\n> \n> \n> \n\n**Yes they are.**  \n\nThe hash negotiated in the cipher suite is completely irrelevant to the certificate. The verification of the certificate and the signatures in the TLS handshake use the hash / signature pair negotiated in the [`signature_algorithms`](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246#page-45) extension. The hash from the cipher suite is called the *[Pseudorandom Function](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/3868/23623)* (PRF) which is used for authentication (in [HMAC-mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC)) for [CBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_block_chaining#Cipher_Block_Chaining_.28CBC.29) cipher suites and [to derive](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246#page-14) the `[master_secret][4]` from the `pre_master_secret`.\n\n> \n> Does the upcoming sunset for SHA-1 relate to the Certificate Signature\n> Algorithm and signature algorithm in the connection cipher suite?\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe sunset of SHA-1 only affects the use of SHA-1 in certificates. The SHA-1 based cipher suites will still be available as [HMAC-SHA-1 isn't broken](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/18575/23623) by collisions on SHA-1.\n\n> \n> If I'm using the latest version of Firefox why does the server/client\n> negotiation not use the preferred SHA-2 algorithm for the connection?\n> \n> \n> \n\nUsually the server picks the cipher suites himself, i.e. the server picks the cipher suite it considers strongest and unfortunately most clients ([including Firefox](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html)) don't support AES-256-GCM but AES-256-CBC so AES-256-CBC gets picked. As for why it picks SHA-1 over SHA-2 then, it's again the support question. Firefox only supports CBC with SHA-1 but not with SHA-2 so SHA-1 gets picked because of the stronger key size.\n\n[In your case](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=online.originenergy.com.au) the server prefers `DHE_RSA_*` over everything else. It prefers `DHE_RSA_AES_*_GCM_*` first, but Firefox doesn't support them (Firefox only supports GCM with `ECDHE_*`) so it picks the next suite in the list which is `DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`.\n\n[From the comments:](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/31479/certificate-signature-algorithm-differs-from-signature-algorithm-negotiated-for/31484?noredirect=1#comment73173_31484)\n\n> \n> [D]oes it alert on intermediate certs as SHA-1 may impact on the clients\n> ability to validate the trust chain?\n> \n> \n> \n\nYes, the browser automatically trusts intermediate certificates signed by a trusted root CA. Thus it may not have seen the exact certificate before, meaning if somebody could find a colliding certificate and somehow make the root CA sign it, you're trusting a malicious certificate (this is the same with leaf certificates).\n\n> \n> Also why not alert on the root cert?\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe browser or the OS have a so-called \"certificate store\" where they store trusted root certificates. There are three reasons why it collisions on SHA-1 don't matter for root certificates.\n\n1. If the root certificate is sent by the server, the browser may just compare this one byte-by-byte to the local copy and thus any change would cause the alert, but the SHA-1 hash isn't verified explicitely.\n2. If the root certificate is sent by the server, the browser may just compute the hash of the received certificate and compare with the hash of the stored certificate. You'd need a second-preimage on SHA-1 to break this which is considered infeasible as of now.\n3. Usually the root certificate isn't sent by the server. In this case the browser looks at the issuer of the intermediate certificate and check if this one is in the trust store and accepts it if it is in there.",

        "answer": "Well, encapsulation is not all about hiding data. It is all about getting control over what is stored in the fields. Using encapsulation we can make a field as read-only or write-only depending upon the requirements.Also the users don't know how the data is stored in the fields. We can use some special encryption in the setter methods and store it in the fields.\n For example human is a object. We only require the name field of the human to be read by the user but not to be modified. Then we define only get method on the name field.This is how the encapsulation is useful.",

        "question": "### Lengthy Explanation of Why I'm Here:\n\n**TLDR; \"force field\" made of electromagnetic radiation.**\n\nRecently, I've decided to compile a list of possible technologies available in the 22nd and 23rd centuries, along with explanations and descriptions. I have already come up with names of some of the technologies (mechs, antimatter engines, etc), and have begun to come up with descriptions.\n\nIn this list is an entry titled **Electromagnetic Shields**. When I came up with the idea, it seemed really simple. Have a bunch of \"nodes\" connected to a quantum supercomputer. The nodes send out electromagnetic waves, and the computer controls the direction, frequency, and amplitude of the waves sent out by each node.\n\nNow attach the nodes to a spacecraft in an irregular lattice arrangement, computationally and uniquely determined by the size and shape of the spacecraft to maximize effectiveness. From the constructive and destructive interference of each electromagnetic wave, assisted by the computer, there now exists an extremely strong (but likely blob-shaped) electromagnetic field, localized to a small region around and away from the spacecraft. Let's call this region of intense electromagnetism the **Annihilation Zone (AZ)**. *Note: the AZ exists a distance away from the spacecraft, to minimize any dangers to crew and craft.*\n\nAny solid or even liquid matter that enters the AZ will experience an electromagnetic force so strong that the ~~intramolecular~~ **intermolecular** forces (I apologize for not remembering the correct term) are overcome, and the matter is ruptured into individual molecules and atoms (small clusters where the AZ is weaker), thus removing any danger of impact. *Note: this material annihilation as a method of shielding is based loosely on* The Ethos Effect *by LE Modesitt Jr.*\n\n### My Question\n\nWhen I began researching electromagnetism to see if this was in any way possible, I ran into a huge problem. Electromagnetism refers to both radiation (light) and electric and magnetic fields. If I'm emitting either *waves or particles*, it's light. If I exhibit a *field*, it's either electric or magnetic. The difference is huge.\n\nIf the nodes do emit waves, all I get is a fancy light show, with maybe a bit of radiative heat. If they exhibit fields, they could seriously mess with the spacecraft itself as well as everything inside.\n\nOr at least, that's what I got out of the Wikipedia page. *\\*Awkward silence\\**\n\nSo, does my theory hold up? Would any of it be possible, given that this is between the 22nd and 23rd centuries?\n\n*EDIT: I'm not asking about the energy involved or conservation of momentum (that's an entirely different question), only if electromagnetic forces would be radiative or electric/magnetic in this instance.*",
        "answer": "I don't think your concept will work\n------------------------------------\n\nYou can not create a \"passive\" electromagnetic field that makes solid or liquid matter fall apart or evaporate it. This is not how electromagnetic fields work. Most of what you would achieve is probably create problems for your ships computers.\n\nThere is an infinite amount of specific energies needed to break certain chemical bonds. While gamma radiation (high energy photons) can break up almost anything they mostly just pass through matter. Interaction is quite unlikely. You need several meters of lead in thickness if you want to make sure that none of the radiation passes through. So simply \"more energy\" is not really helpful, either.\n\nAlso, if you would radiate enough photons to evaporate anything coming towards you would shine like a sun. Unless you are fueled by a sun, I see a problem with this idea.",

        "answer": "It is not creating a second class, it is creating one class of type Stack where StackType is being supplanted by a user-given type. A better way to define this is to use typename (\u00a714.1.2), which makes it more clear what is actually going on. For more information on templates, see [C++ Templates](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/templates/).\n\nWhat you are describing is nested classes in templates:\n\n```\ntemplate <typename Type>\nclass Stack\n{\npublic:\n    class InnerType\n    {\n    };\n};\n\n```\n\nIn this example, InnerType is a class whose strong name is `Stack<Type>::InnerType`, which is a specific class based on the provided type. So if somewhere in code an object is created as follows:\n\n```\nauto x = new Stack<int>();\n\n```\n\nthen a class of type `Stack<int>::InnerType` will exist. Template classes only exist in the assembly when they are used in code, so if no objects of any variation of `Stack` are implemented, the `InnerType` (of any template type) will not exist.\n\nAlso further detail about declaring templates is [discussed here on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2023977/c-difference-of-keywords-typename-and-class-in-templates).",

There is a large amount of subjectivity to the issue -- for example, a question about mathematics will likely seem harder to a person with no mathematics background in their education.\n\nYou can't classify the \"difficultly\" of questions in general with an algorithm; you'll have to do it yourself.\n\nOne such strategy might be to introduce the concept of topics into your game, and lump each question into one or topics. Within that topic, assign each question a difficulty level (manually, based on your own personal assessment of the question). Then sorting from easy-to-hard becomes a simple matter of sorting on the scale you define for the difficulty (for example, one to ten). The topic does not need to participate in the sort, it's purely for taxonomic purposes. \n\nYou'll probably have to tweak those difficulties during play-testing. I'd suggest building in a feedback mechanism into your beta builds -- after every question, show the user the topic and difficulty of the question (as in, \"that question had a difficulty of 3/10 in the math topic. Do you agree with that difficulty assessment?\") and record their responses so you can make adjustments.\n\nAs with all data-collection programs, make sure your beta testers are aware that you'll be collecting their responses to these questions.",

That problem was fixed.\n[See that question here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2792427/memory-leak-with-contextmenustrip/)\n\nNow I'm having similar issues with ToolStrip controls.\nAs in the previous problem, I'm creating a large number of UserControls and adding them to a FlowLayoutPanel. Each control creates a ToolStrip for itself in its constructor. When a control is removed from the FlowLayoutPanel (the only reference to the control), it seems memory for the ToolStrip is not being released. \n\nHowever when I comment out the code that creates the ToolStrip the memory leak doesn't happen.\n\nIs this the same sort of issue as the previous one - I need to set the ToolStrip to null? I don't see how that could be since this time the control is creating the strip itself, and all the button events etc are handled inside it. So shouldn't everything be GC'd when the control is no longer referenced?\n\n*EDIT:*\nAs to the comments, the thing I don't understand is originally I was \"making\" my own toolstrip out of a panel and some labels. The labels were used as buttons. No memory leaks occurred this way. \n\nThe only thing I've changed is using a proper ToolStrip with proper buttons in place of the panel, but all the event handlers are wired the same way. So why is it now leaking memory?\n\nEDIT2:\nI was just about to post my code but reread the question Dave linked to. It turns out it was the UserPreferenceChangedEvent problem of the ToolStrip. If I set the ToolStrip.Visible property to false, the memory leak doesn't happen!\n\nNow, could I do this in the Dispose method? If so how?

        "answer": "Firstly, this assignment\n\n```\nboard=Board(5,5);\n\n```\n\nis over-complicated. You can just declare\n\n```\nBoard board(5,5);\n\n```\n\ndirectly (the extra work may well be optimized out, but it's un-idiomatic).\n\n---\n\nSecondly, everywhere you do something like:\n\n```\nvoid Board::copy(const Board &t) {\n    int a_l, a_c;\n    int ** a_mp;\n\n```\n\nyou're *shadowing* the object's member variables. That is, `a_l` now refers to the local integer variable inside this function, instead of the object member. You'll have to refer to `this->a_l` if you want to see or change the object.\n\n---\n\nNow, the copy constructor\n\n```\nBoard::Board(const Board&t) {\n    a_l=t.a_l;\n    a_c=t.a_c;\n    a_mp=t.a_mp;\n    Memory();\n    copy(t);\n}\n\n```\n\ndoes:\n\n1. a *shallow* copy (it shares the `a_mp` pointer with the object you're copying)\n2. calls `Memory` which allocates a *new* lump of memory, referred to as `a_mp` only inside `Memory`, and then leaked (when that local variable goes out of scope)\n3. calls `copy`, which copies the original objects values into an *uninitialized* local pointer also called `a_mp` (this is undefined behaviour, because those writes could go anywhere)\n4. ends up with the value of `a_mp` it first chose, so now *two* `Board` instances have the same `a_mp` value, and it will be freed twice.\n\n---\n\nHere's some sample code that fixes those problems: I've changed the structure of your code as little as possible (bar renaming things for readability). There's plenty of room for improvement, but it should at least be correct.\n\n```\nclass Board {\n    int rows;\n    int cols;\n    char **data;\npublic:\n    Board(): rows(0), cols(0), data(0) {}\n    Board(int nl, int nc) : rows(nl), cols(nc) \n    {\n        allocate_data();\n    }\n    Board(const Board& other)\n        : rows(other.rows), cols(other.cols)\n    {\n        allocate_data();\n        copy_data(other);\n    }\n    ~Board() {\n        free_data();\n    }\nprivate:\n    void copy_data(const Board &other) {\n        for(int r=0; r<rows; r++)\n            for(int c=0; c<cols; c++)\n                data[r][c]=t.data[r][c];\n    }\n    void free_data() {\n        for(int r=0; r<rows; r++)\n            delete [] data[r];\n        delete [] data;\n    }\n    void allocate_data() {\n        data = new char*[rows];\n        for(int r=0; r<rows; r++) {\n            data[r]=new char[cols];\n            for(int c=0; c<cols; c++)\n                data[r][c]='-';\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n```\n\nNote that this works fine if you *only* use the copy constructor, but the default-generated assignment operator will still be wrong. As Daniel Weber pointed out in a comment, the [rule of three](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28C%2B%2B_programming%29) suggests you ought to write this as well:\n\n```\n    Board& operator=(const Board& other) {\n        free_data();\n        rows = other.rows;\n        cols = other.cols;\n        allocate_data();\n        copy_data(other);\n    }\n\n```\n\nNote that the copy assignment operator needs to cope with a destination object which is already initialized, and may not have the right dimensions. You could improve this to only re-allocate if the new (`other`) board is larger.\n\nIf you have C++11 support, you can also add the *move* equivalents of the copy constructor and assignment operator:\n\n```\n    Board(Board&& original)\n        : rows(original.rows), cols(original.cols)\n    {\n        data = original.data;\n        original.data = NULL;\n    }\n    Board& operator=(Board&& original) {\n        free_data();\n        rows = original.rows;\n        cols = original.cols;\n        data = original.data;\n        original.data = NULL;\n    }\n\n```",

This repository is cloned somewhere on the development partition of my hard drive. I then created a Symlink using the `mklink.exe` tool (I am on Windows) to the settings file in my repository in the default user settings directory (`path-to-user/AppData/Roaming/Code/User/` on Windows). The only drawback is that you can't move the repository, or change its layout without having to recreate the link.\n\nChanging the Symlink to a Hardlink is not advised as explained in [this](https://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/git-dotfiles-and-hardlinks/) blog-post. Also Hardlinks seem to mess up the timestamps on Windows, so you won't see any changes made to `settings.json` from within VSCode. The Symlink seems to be working tho.",

        "question": "Before I say anything else, let me say Salesforce Stack Exchange is a great resource with some truly amazing contributors.\n\nI've learned a lot from both the answers to my own questions as well as the answers to many other questions. Sometimes I even learn not from actual answers but from the process of trying to phrase an intelligent question.\n\nHowever, since I'm not a moderator, I don't know what sort of user experience I should be thanking them for what I feel is a heavy handed approach.\n\nI've had a few questions closed as \"duplicates\" despite there being nuances to my ask which truly made my **QUESTIONS** unique even if the answers had large degrees of overlap. And someone might have different ideas leading to a completely different answer which might be useful or interesting, perhaps in some instances even a better fit for the actual question at hand.\n\nI've had a few questions -- specifically intended to better understand the platform and be better able to render my own judgements about **BEST PRACTICES** -- put on hold because they are opinion based. (Never mind that SFDC is a platform infamous for bad [or at least controversial] practices, that more discussion really needs to take place so developers will make good decisions rather than either simply continue bad practices or ignore issues.)\n\nFortunately, I got some great responses to these questions before the moderators did their dirty work, but I don't know how much more useful ideas of information I might have received if these questions were left open.\n\nMoreover, I don't have any idea of the great dialogues I would not be missing if other questions were allowed to take their course.\n\nWhy is it good to cut these conversations short? Are you trying to reduce the load on the servers or the database? Are you trying to game Google?\n\nBTW, I'm at least a user who has realised the value of this platform and have a thick enough skin not to let it get to me (too much) when the people running the show seem to have too little appreciation of my participation. How do you think this might make a new user feel?\n\nAs reasonable discourse necessitates an agreement what words mean, allow me to provide standard dictionary definitions of two important terms:\n\n**question**: A sentence worded or expressed so as to elicit information.\n\n**answer**: A response or reply; something said or done in reaction to a statement or question.",
        "answer": "There are only three moderators, and we all have a little diamond by our name whenever we make a post or comment. When we close a question, it can be single-handed and for the most part we try to be careful and not rule with an iron fist.\n\nYou seem to be blaming moderators for actions they took no part in, here. If you look at [your](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/q/221865/2995) [three](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/q/221867/2995) [questions](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/q/219375/2995) closed within the last day, none of them were closed by a moderator. Standard users who have enough reputation are also able to vote to collectively close questions, and it takes five users agreeing to actually close a post.\n\nDespite the fact I had nothing to do with these posts being closed, I think the reasons were correct and wouldn't personally vote to reopen. Our reopen votes are also unilateral, so unless I'm clearly on one side of the fence I try to stay out of it.\n\n---\n\nHere's the crux of the issue. You seem to be seeking *discussions*, but **SFSE is not a *discussion board***. The format here is ***specific* questions and answers**. If you want in depth discussions on these or other topics, you might try:\n\n* Developer User Groups\n* Salesforce Developer Forum\n* Blogging\n\nI'm sure there are other great options out there I missed. A good indicator that your question is too discussion oriented is if you feel compelled to post follow up in the comments. That shouldn't be a frequent occurrence and you should always assume your comments will be deleted sooner or later.\n\n---\n\nAs for your specific posts:\n\n1. [(Why?) Is it good for Apex classes and methods to be final?](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/q/221865/2995)\n\nThe very title already strongly indicates you are looking for opinions. Asking what is good or bad is going to get closed quite often for this reason. Also, \"why\" questions tend to be exceedingly difficult to answer for anyone who did not build out the feature you are asking about.\n2. [(Why?) Is it good for Apex methods to be static?](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/q/221867/2995)\n\nSame as above.\n3. [What deep magic exists in Apex and can we replicate it?](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/q/219375/2995)\n\nThis question is practically textbook definition of \"too broad\". There could be hundreds of answers, with no single answer being definitive. In addition, it is quite vague as to what kind of answer even fits your criteria. Of the three, this question is the farthest off topic.",

        "answer": "Forget D2010 Datasnap. It's still a half backed solution lacking a lot in flexibility and security. It will only work in very simple scenarios, and it's unusable in any real application due to its many flaws.\n\n**Update**: because I am said my answer was argumentative and not helpful, I'll give you the full answer: connections through a proxy - but a transparent one - are not supported. If you look at the implementation of TDSHTTPNativeClient, you'll see it instantiates a TidHTTP component, which would allow a proxy to be set, but the implementation totally overlooked the need to set a proxy, because, you know, proxies are so rarely used today that there was no need to think about them ;). That component is private, thereby you can't access it easily. You could try with some RTTI code, or you could try to modify yourself the DSHTTPLayer.pas unit to add the missing pieces. All that to set what should have been a basic supported feature out of the box.\nBut as long as you try to use this Datasnap, you will encounter many other basic issues, look in Quality Central for them. Again, my advice is to avoid this Datasnap unless you have very basic remoting needs, until Embarcadero makes it a true professional remoting library and not a toy.\n\n**Update 2**: I've added a request to support a proxy to Quality Central, [#85467](http://qc.embarcadero.com/wc/qcmain.aspx?d=85467)",

        "question": "I have a class `Target` with a \"fileType\" `enum` which holds all kinds of files my parser needs to know about (currently SOURCE, HEADER, RESOURCE). I'd like my Parsing function to be able to do something generic like:\n\n```\nif( token == some_known_fileType )\n    put_nextToken_in_the_list_for_that_fileType();\nelse\n    return an_error();\n\n```\n\nBut there's a catch: I'd like to be able to simply extend the known fileTypes with subclasses of `Target`, that extend the `enum` in a correct way, see [Base enum class inheritance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/644629/base-enum-class-inheritance) for how I did this. I don't want to modify the above code, but only generically extend the Target half. C++0X may be required and is very welcome.\n\nThanks!\n\n**UPDATE:** Upon trying to explain it here and posting some reduced class declarations, I realised my design is broken, and I tried to push the specialization of fileType too deep in my class structure. I wanted only one place to store a full list of all known types, but in trying to do so, I accidentally forced the design to have access to that list in two places at a time. I now realise that the list of all fileTypes should be where the keywords SOURCE, HEADER, etc. are read, and be handled \\*generically from thereon. I will store a full list in one place, and access that list through a \"huge\" `enum` later on. A `std::map<fileType, std::set<std::string> >` pops into my head as a logical choice here, instead of seperately named `set` for each specific `fileType`. Thanks for the braincandy in your responses though! Any thoughts are still welcome.",

My code also uses a few different methodologies to **avoid manual assembly of JSON, URL query strings, etc.** (see lines 3-41 of the provided code)\n\n**Issues**\n\n1. You are not encoding the query parameter values - can be fixed with `urlencode` of the param values, but I prefer `http_build_query` for reasons noted in my introductory paragraph.\n2. You are not sending a User Agent (UA) header (The distant end seems to require a value in this header but doesn't care what it is. Having received a request with a UA I think it must whitelist the IP for a few moments as it doesn't seem to require it on every request. I would just send it for every request, though, as it doesn't hurt and you never know when your whitelist will timeout).

        "answer": "You have to create the date without the hour part first, something like this:\n\n```\nvar moment = require(\"moment\");\nvar unixTime = moment().startOf('day').unix(); //last midnight in local time\n\n  console.log(\"Your timestamp: \" + unixTime + \" And your date: \" + day);\n\n```\n\nNow, let's see your examples. \n\nYo said that this unix timestamp `1446073200` but, you when you check [here](http://www.convert-unix-time.com/?t=1446073200), you can see that this is the date that represents:\n\n```\nUTC: Wednesday 28th October 2015 11:00:00 PM\n\n```\n\nAnd also gives you another date with your local time, which in my case:\n\n```\nIn your local time zone: Wednesday 28th October 2015 05:00:00 PM\n\n```\n\nSo, my guess is that you are getting that unix timestamps in a place with timezone `UTC + 1` and that's why you believe that this unix timestamp `1446073200` has no the `hour part`.\n\nIn my previous example you will get a unix timestamp in your local time, which in my case is: `1446098400`, but you will probably want the UTC time, so you should change the code a little bit, like this:\n\n```\nvar moment = require(\"moment\");\nvar unixTime = moment.utc().startOf('day').unix(); //last midnight in UTC time\n\n  console.log(\"Your timestamp: \" + unixTime + \" And your date: \" + day);\n\n```\n\nThat will give you this unix timestamp: `1446076800`which is the one you need. You can check it [here](http://www.convert-unix-time.com/?t=1446076800).\n\n```\nUTC: Thursday 29th October 2015 12:00:00 AM\n\n```\n\n*I simplified my code using @forgo answer.*",

        "answer": "There's several sides to this issues that I've seen and even have done myself. I'll talk about a few of them, but there's more than I can cover as well as variations and combination of things that are far too many for even think about.\n\nInsecurity\n==========\n\nThe other dev could be insecure about their abilities, so they take the easiest things to work on, knowing it's within their capabilities. They do it to try to impress people with their skills as well as getting an ego boost. This isn't always a bad thing, but it can definitely be annoying or even a major problem if they are literally always doing this. Also, if they are literally doing this all the time, they are likely wasting a lot of time looking at the job queue instead of doing their normal work.\n\nBurnt-out\n=========\n\nSometimes people just need to take some easy tasks to either prevent or recover from working too hard. This will be something done on a fairly short term basis and will go away as suddenly as it started.\n\nSimilarly, there may be some things going on at home that are temporarily increasing their stress, so they need to get some easy stuff on their plate to be able to handle things at home better.\n\nEgotist\n=======\n\nSimilar to the insecure dev, and egotist will take all the easy jobs to impress people, but will do it to prevent anyone else from being able to do it, then show the boss how many tasks they were able to perform, as compared to other people. If you have a point system for tasks, they may even be able to rack up a bunch of points this way, while others trudge along with higher point tasks that take considerably longer to do. This type is specifically doing it to further themselves and/or to hinder others.\n\nLazy\n====\n\nSometimes you'll get someone who doesn't have a very good work ethic or simply knows their time at that employer is short. It could be short due to a recent move in jobs that hasn't taken effect yet, the end of a contract coming up, or they just don't care and are willing to get fired to get out of the job.\n\nHelper\n======\n\nThis is the type of person who sees something really easy and to not waste time of others who are clearly better to be doing harder projects, they take the easy stuff. This allows others to concentrate on getting the real work done.\n\nObservation\n===========\n\nFrom what you've described, your co-worker is a bit of a mix between insecure and egotist. They may not be doing this to specifically hurt others, but they seem to be doing it to boost their rank in the eyes of the boss. Which way they lean (as to egotist or insecure) depends on why they are doing it.\n\nYour manager/boss should have a policy on how work is taken, but if there isn't a policy or the policy is vague, it needs to be implemented to prevent this type of \"sniping\" work. No policy will be able to prevent all of it, but a decent policy should be able to prevent some of it without making people mad. You co-worker may think they are the \"helper\" type, so continuing to let them know it isn't actually helping will fix this. Knowing why people do things will make it easier to figure out how to prevent them from doing undesirable things.\n\nSome things need to be done in a specific order. If they do things out of order, it'll cause more problems. Make sure people know about these situations. They shouldn't come up very often, but they can.\n\nNot your job\n============\n\nJust to keep things in perspective, you correcting your co-worker is not your job. It's the job of your boss/manager or your team lead. That said, you mentioning it in a non-accusatory fashion can be useful. Offer solutions, instead of whining or suggesting punishments. Suggest a better policy for handing out work. Suggest peer programming for more training. Suggest something that'll show forward movement in policy, whatever it may be, rather than negativity. You should be offering these to your superiors, not your co-worker specifically. You can offer them in a team meeting in a way that all of you can make things better, just don't single out anyone. Doing so will not win you any friends.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nThere's things that you can do and things you can't do to fix this problem. Even if you do make progress with policy, you aren't going to fix every problem. Anyone who is willing to spend the time will be able to \"game the system\", unless doing the real/normal is more interesting or less actual work than trying to cheat. And trying to prevent all forms of cheating will likely cause a lot more work for everyone as well as while trying to prevent the cheating.",

        "question": "Some commercial services sell certificates to manuscript authors. Frequently these certificates are marketed to authors in developing countries where English is not widely spoken. These services claim that the certificate indicates that the manuscript meets a certain standard of quality. Often the certificate states that the manuscript is written in correct English. The certificate may be accompanied by editing services.\n\nShould I pay for a certificate and send the certificate to a journal?\n\n*This is a general question is inspired by [this one](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/147184/) to avoid talking about a specific service.*",
        "answer": "No (reputable) journal is going to give any weight to such a certificate when assessing a paper. If the editor/reviewers aren't satisfied with the quality of the English, they will reject the paper.\n\nThus, paying for a certificate for its own sake is a waste of money. Of course, if the certificate is issued in conjunction with editing services, there may (or may not!) be value in the overall package.",

        "question": "Given a regular curve $\\gamma \\colon I \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, if we consider the variable $t \\in I \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ as the time, then we have the usual interpretation of $\\gamma'(t)$ as the (instantaneous) velocity vector at the position $\\gamma(t)$ and $\\lvert\\gamma'(t)\\rvert$ as the speed (or scalar velocity).\n\nFrom this point of view, we know from differential geometry (very classical examples, indeed) that there are curves that \"go through infinite length in a bounded amount of time\". Of course, at these examples, the speed of these curves increase infinitely (\"goes to infinity\").\n\nI have very rough ideas concerning Relativity Theory (I'm a mathematician, not a physicist) but I know that, for example, the speed a object can reach is bounded by the speed of light, and that mass, lengths and even the time are distorted at very high speed (near the speed of light).\n\nAs I said, I'm not an expert on this subject, so maybe my question even make sense, but what axioms do I insert to my models in order to get such results, from a purely mathematical/axiomatic point of view? Is the answer to this \"the Einstein postulates\"?\n\nI want to know also if there is an area which study this kind of \"differential geometry + relativity\" (or even a \"Riemannian geometry + relativity\"). Would the answer to this question be simply \"Relativity\"? (as I said, I don't have a deep knowledge on that).\n\n(Is there) Do you recommend any references at this subject?",
