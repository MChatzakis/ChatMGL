        "question": "In the film *[Triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_%282009_British_film%29)*, we learn at the very end of the film,\n\n> \n>  that the Jess we meet in the beginning already went through the loop (maybe even all of them). She remembers what happens on the liner, and she must remember that her main goal was to stop the entire crew from stepping onto the liner.\n> \n> \n> \n\nWhen the moment comes when the crew wants to be \"rescued\" by the liner, why didn't she try to stop them? She hesitates, but doesn't act on it. Why?",
        "answer": "Okay Triangle is actually not a time-travel movie even though it seems like one. So she actually is forgetting what happened before due to traumatic event stress and because of where she actually is. It's actually hell. Or at least it is Jessie's personal hell. Most of what we see is her replaying events onboard a ship named Sisyphus which is the king in Greek myth that was sentenced to an afterlife in Hades pushing a boulder up a hill only to watch it roll back down and have to repeat this forever. \n\nHere is the most logical set of actual events that actually happened. Jess was a shitty mother to her autistic child. She had him in the car and was driving to the boat when a pelican hit the windshield. She pulled over to throw the bird off a cliff but didn't wipe the blood off , probably because she wanted to make the boat. Her kid freaked out and she turned to yell at him and wrecked. This killed her and most likely her kid. Then the taxi driver shows up (grim reaper/Ferryman) and she goes to the boat. The rest that we see is her reliving the events and trying to change the outcome but it's useless because she is already dead and this is her hell. She never realizes this and the audience is never given the full explanation.",

        "question": "When I construct a new `BufferedReader` it is providing me a buffer of 8192 characters. What is the logic/reason behind this?\n\n```\n8192 = 2 to the power of 13\n\n```",
        "answer": "Traditionally, memory managers and paging files in the operating system work on pages that are sized in powers of 2. This allows very efficient multiply/divide operations to be performed with left/right shift operations. When working with a buffer, the worst case scenario is to have a buffer with size 1 byte longer than the page size (that would result in an extra page swap with very low benefit). So the default buffer sizes will also tend to be implemented in factors of two.\n\nI'd assume (but have not checked) that the JVM looks for buffers like this and attempts to align them on page boundaries.\n\nWhy does this matter? Page misses are quite expensive. If you are doing a ton of IO, it's better to avoid the case where the page backing the buffer gets swapped out to disk (kind of defeats the purpose of the buffer). That said, for most applications, this is a micro-optimization, and for the vast majority of cases, the default is fine.\n\nFor reference, Windows and Linux both currently use a 4KB memory page size. So the default buffer on BufferedReader will consume exactly 2 pages.",

        "answer": "Actually, there appears to now be a simple way. The following code works in TypeScript 1.5:\n\n```js\nfunction sayName({ first, last = 'Smith' }: {first: string; last?: string }): void {\n  const name = first + ' ' + last;\n  console.log(name);\n}\n\nsayName({ first: 'Bob' });\n\n```\n\nThe trick is to first put in brackets what keys you want to pick from the argument object, with `key=value` for any defaults. Follow that with the `:` and a type declaration.\n\nThis is a little different than what you were trying to do, because instead of having an intact `params` object, you have instead have dereferenced variables.\n\nIf you want to make it optional to pass anything to the function, add a `?` for all keys in the type, and add a default of `={}` after the type declaration:\n\n```\nfunction sayName({first='Bob',last='Smith'}: {first?: string; last?: string}={}){\n    var name = first + \" \" + last;\n    alert(name);\n}\n\nsayName();\n\n```",

        "answer": "I have tried to create a python 2 / 3 answer.\n\npython 2 `input` interprets your input, converting to integers if possible for instance. So you cannot have an integer AND a string. When entering `quit`, since `quit` isn't known by the interpreter, you get a `NameError`\n\nThe only way to make it work would be to type `\"quit\"`. But that'd be python 2 only still... Let's try to make it portable now.\n\npython 3 fails when comparing strings to numbers, because `input` returns strings.\n\nYou'll have a hard time creating a code which works for both versions. I'd suggest this:\n\n```\nimport random\n\n# detect/create a portable raw_input for python 2/3\ntry:\n    raw_input\nexcept NameError:\n    raw_input = input\n\nwhile True:\n    ROLL=raw_input(\"What sided Die would you like to roll(You may enter quit to close)? \")\n    if ROLL.isdigit():\n        ROLL = int(ROLL)\n\n    if ROLL in [6,8,10,12,20]:\n        print(random.randint(1, ROLL))\n    elif ROLL == \"quit\":\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"That's not an option please choose a die...\")\n\n```\n\nThe first `try`/`except` block is there for python 2/3 compatibility. If `raw_input` exists, use it, else define it as `input` for python 3. From now on, `raw_input` is used, and returns *strings* not integers.\n\nNow we have to add this: `if ROLL.isdigit()` tests if the string could be converted as an integer. If it's possible, it converts it.\n\nNow we test if the reply is contained in the choice list, and if it is, we use `ROLL` for our random (avoids the ton of `elif` statements).\n\nThe loop has been turned to inconditional too, no need to initialize `ROLL` at start. Just `break` if `quit` is entered.",

        "answer": "### Answer\n\nThis seems to be related to this announcement of a vulnerability:\n<https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/>\n\nI think it has less to do with your email, and more with the owner of the directories on your filesystem.\nIs the user you're currently logged in with also the owner of the folder?\nHow about the parent folder?\nAlso, are you invoking git from within the repository directory?\nThe update is only a few hours old, so I guess things are still in flux.\n\nFor now, as the message from git suggests, execute\n\n```\ngit config --global --add safe.directory F:/GitHub/my-project\n\n```\n\nand make sure you are calling `git` from within `F:/GitHub/my-project` for now.\n\n**EDIT**: As we found out in the comments below, the owner of the parent of the directory containing the `.git` folder (the git repository) is the issue.  \n\nCloning the project anew is a platform independent way to make sure you are the owner.\n\n### Sidenote\n\nI ran into the same problem using flutter on Linux, which on my distro was installed in `/opt/flutter`. I am not working as root, thus I run into the same problem.\nRunning `git config --global --add safe.directory /opt/flutter` did indeed fix the problem for me.\n\n### Longer edit: Clarification\n\nGoing through the post about the vulnerability again after a good night's sleep, I think a bit of clarification is in order. I'll leave the rest of the answer as is.  \n\nLets look at the following simple directory structure.\n\n```\n/home/\n\u251c\u2500 tommy/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 .git/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 rental_space/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 mary/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 projects/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 phone_app/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 .git/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 anthony/\n\n```\n\nIn this case, the user `tommy` owns his own directory under `/home`, but (for some reason) rents out space to other users, in this case `mary` and `anthony`.   \n\nIf `mary`, by mistake, where to execute `git` in her directory, but outside of her `phone_app` project, then old `git` would go up the directory tree to search a `.git` repository. The first it finds is the one from `/home/tommy/.git`. This is a security risk, because another user, in this case anyone that can act as `tommy`, can affect `mary`'s execution of git and possibly cause trouble.  \n\nFrom Git v2.35.2 and onward, the traversal will stop as soon as the directory entered belongs to a user other than `mary`. Say `mary` executed `git` in `/home/tommy/rental_space/mary/projects`, then git will check in `projects`, but find no `.git`. It will go up one directory, check in `mary`, but again find no `.git`. Then it will again go up, but `rental_space` belongs to `tommy`, not `mary`. The new git version will stop here and print the message we saw in the question.  \n\nAdding the directory `/home/tommy/rental_space` to the `safe.directory` variable would allow git to proceed but is, as explained, a security risk.\n\nI used a Linux-like directory structure here, but the same is true on Windows.",

        "answer": "Since you want internal scrolling on the bottom div, I'm assuming you want the bottom div to be fluid vertically (rather--fluid to browser window size, not to content) as well as horizontally. (Being fluid horizontally really doesn't have much to do with a any solution to a vertical offset.) And since that's the case, your header has to be a set height. If the bottom div doesn't need to be fluid vertically, you can just set `height` to the desired number and declare `overflow-y:scroll`.\n\nFor vertical fluidity, you'll need to use [conflicting absolute positions](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/conflictingabsolutepositions/), setting the bottom div to start just below where the top div ends and going down to the bottom of the page. Essentially:\n\n```\n#bottomDiv {\n  position: absolute;    \n  top: 100px; /* however tall your top div is */\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nNote the expression you'll have to use for IE6 (laid out in the article linked to, above).\n\n**Update** Why can't you modify `.fullContainer`? If it's just that that's in another stylesheet, try anyway. The way CSS works, you can override anything that's come before it. So, if in your editable area you can add a fullContainer rule (which you should be able to, if you're editing the CSS file at all), you very likely could redefine that div to get rid of the width and height declarations (`width:auto` and `height:auto` should do) and similarly reset or override other things (e.g., `overflow:hidden` if necessary).\n\nThe other option is to try to make both your desired (new) top and bottom divs use `position:fixed`, but note that fixed positions are notoriously buggy on some browsers, and you might want to avoid it as fragile for laying out your whole site. \n\n**Update 2** For IE6, you're using 100% height plus padding, which means it will be automatically too tall. In the [article I point to](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/conflictingabsolutepositions/), search for 'Creating the exception for IE5 and IE6' and use those expressions--if you can't put them in separate stylesheets, just use the star hack you're already using.",

(Note: Specifically looking at reliability of inexpensive 7200rpm drives, preferably FireWire.) \n\n---\n\nI woke up to a dead mirrored RAID disk today... but, that's what mirroring is for. My literal life's work of photography and audio from the remaining RAID disk is being backed up to a second RAID as I type.

I've been buying [LaCie d2](http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?pid=11156) drives because they're inexpensive and individually rack-mountable without needing to buy a big, spendy (and overly deep) dedicated rack mount enclosure. I buy in identical pairs and then stripe them as RAIDs.\n\nIn a house with eight of these things lying around, the failures are starting to mount (I'd say 50/50 split between power supplies dying and disks themselves dying) and I'm looking to hear about folks' experience with other brands of drives.\n\n[![Lacie d2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vYje3.jpg)](http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?pid=11156)  \n\n(source: [lacie.com](http://www.lacie.com/imgstore/product_medium/hd_d2quadranext.jpg))",

But Strong cites the derivation of \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (859) as \u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9 (863). And there is a possibility that it is from \u03b1-\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf, although Liddel & Scott, whilst being abundant in cataloguing \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf - devoting a whole page to it and giving it a variety of meanings which, generally, suggest the conveying or carrying of something adverse or burdensome - do not list \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf at all.\n\nIt may be that \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf-\u03b9\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9 underlies \u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9 , which in turn underlies \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. And in the background is the word \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf; which adds meaning without being a direct derivative. But it is also possible that \u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9 is a direct negative of \u03c6\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9, in which case \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is a matter [Young and L&S] of \u2018un-saying\u2019 something, thus releasing an obligation. Which would be very close to, and an enhancement of, the meaning of \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf, \u2018unburden\u2019, if such a word ever existed.\n\nLiddel & Scott make it clear that the usage of \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 in non-biblical literature is, sometimes, a matter of release, both of horses from a starting post and of waters from a sluice gate. The result of \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, therefore, appears to be - in those particular usages - a gushing out, a pouring out, a rushing forth.\n\nThe fact that Luke uses \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, twice, to convey two slightly different concepts in the Isaiah quotation, agrees with the idea that \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is a broad concept which encompasses other, subsidiary meanings.\n\nSo my Question is - what English word can be used to convey, consistently, the word \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ? for \u2018remission\u2019 refers to things, not persons, and Luke 4:18 makes it very clear that, although (twelve times, listed by Young) the expression \u2018the *aphesis* of *hamartia*\u2019 is stated in the bible, nevertheless the ***effect*** of \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 is upon persons.\n\nDoes the \u2018un-saying\u2019 of sins then \u2018unburden\u2019 the recipient; and thus \u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, with its varied heritage, expresses both concepts within one word ? And what word in English would do such a thing ?\n\nIf no word can be suggested, then I would be minded, in the future, to transliterate the Greek and thereafter use \u2018aphesis\u2019, without italics, as an English word; and to simply bear in mind the wealth of association that is clustered around it.\n\n===============================================================\n\n* Click below for the 'aphesis table' :\n\n[Aphesis](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxiZWxtb250cHVibGljYXRpb25zfGd4OjJlZDYwNDFlMzZlMWIzYmU)",
        "answer": "I find ***acquittal*** or ***setting free [from guilt]*** to fit every usage in the New Testament, of which there are 17 (of which 10 are used by St. Luke), except for one in in ***Luke 4:18***, but it falls into the category of a generic *release* or *relief* from a situation (which definition also fits well non-personal subjects), not a more personal ('forgiveness'); 'forgive' or 'acquit' being a more implicit nuance to the more literal meaning.\n\n**That is, 'release' would work for *all* uses** (the \"subsidiary\" uses being injured somewhat by the literalness, though, in which cases 'forgive' is usually used).\n\nAs to its derivation, it is said to be derived from apo ([away] from) *heimi* (send, put), hence *\u1f00\u03c6\u03af\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9* (send away).\n\nOur English 'forgive' is actually of a similar etymology, in that the Old English *forgiefan*, derived from 'for' (away, opposite, completely) and 'geifan' (give [up, away]). That is, take away the need or exercising of just exactment on someone or something for a crime or debt. And in the case of a captive, send them free from whence someone else had imprisoned them; or in the case of a non-personal entity, to *issue forth* or *release* to *empty/clear out from*.\n\nThus, *acquit* or *set free* from some form of debt, obligation, sin, crime.

        "question": "How to delete the line after the first line that contains the pattern `invHn3ion?` and then move the first line to the end of the file?\n\nWhere can I learn all those expressions?",
        "answer": "Let's start with something simpler. In the vi editor, to move the first line to the end, use the `ex` command `m` (move):\n\n```\n:1m$\n\n```\n\nThe `1` argument is the source range: just the first line. You can use a range like `2,15m$` or a pattern match `/a.*bc/m$`. The destination `$` denotes the last line of the file. The `m` command places the moved material **after** the target position.\n\nThere is no line zero, but the target 0 specifies the top of the file. So to move the line back to where it was:\n\n```\n:$m0\n\n```\n\nI.e. move the last line **after** the fictitious line zero (thus before line 1).\n\nOkay, so how about moving the first line which matches the pattern `invHn3ion`?\nFirstly we have consider that the current position could be anywhere. We want to start the search from the first line, not from the current position, thus:\n\n```\n:1/invHn3ion/m$\n\n```\n\nWhat's happening here is that `m` actually operates on the address argument `/invHn3ion/`. The `1` is a superfluous address which is evaluated and discarded1. We could get the same effect with two separate commands:\n\n```\n:1\n:/invHn3ion/m$\n\n```\n\nThe `m` command has a sibling `t` (transfer) which copies rather than moves.\n\n---\n\n1.

        "question": "I am a developer of an Open Source library. One of our classes is templated for a bunch of different types. Currently the definition resides in the header file, which has a negative effect on compilation times and also forces users to include more headers than needed. My goal is the following:\n\n* To reduce compilation time, I want to make use of the the explicit instantiation declaration introduced with C++11.\n* The definition of the class methods and members, which all are static, must be separate from the declaration in an implementation file. They should be available for usage outside and inside the library without users having to do an explicit instantiation definition or anything like this.\n* This must run cross-platform on all common compilers that support C++11 (Visual Studio 2013+, GCC, etc)\n\nC++11 is providing new features for class templates, in specific the \"[explicit instantiation declaration](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template)\". As far as I understand this can be used in this context. Previous questions dealt with this in similar contexts, e.g. [How to use extern template](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6870885/how-to-use-extern-template) and [Separating definition/instantiation of template classes without 'extern'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22575883/separating-definition-instantiation-of-template-classes-without-extern) but those do not deal with library exports and their solution cause linker errors if a client tries to use the shared library.\n\nCurrently I have managed to implement this in a way it compiles, links and runs on Visual Studio 2015, but I am unsure if I use the keywords correctly, especially the \\_\\_declspec one in this case. This is what I got (simplified):\n\n```\n// class.h\ntemplate<typename T>\nclass PropertyHelper;\n\ntemplate<typename T>\nclass PropertyHelper<const T>\n{\npublic:\n    typedef typename PropertyHelper<T>::return_type return_type;\n\n    static inline return_type fromString(const String& str)\n    {\n        return PropertyHelper<T>::fromString(str);\n    }\n\n    static const int SomeValue;\n};\n\ntemplate<>\nclass EXPORTDEF PropertyHelper<float>\n{\npublic:\n    typedef float return_type;\n\n    static return_type fromString(const String& str);\n\n    static const int SomeValue;\n};\n\nextern template EXPORTDEF class PropertyHelper<float>;\n\n```\n\nThe last line is the explicit instantiation declaration. As far as I understand this means that clients do not have to declare this themselves every time. `EXPORTDEF` is a define that is either \\_\\_declspec(dllexport) or \\_\\_declspec(dllimport) on Windows. I am not sure if I need to place this in the line above, because the following also compiles, links and runs:\n\n```\nextern template class PropertyHelper<float>;\n\n```\n\nThe cpp file looks like this:\n\n```\nconst int PropertyHelper<float>::SomeValue(12);\n\nPropertyHelper<float>::return_type\nPropertyHelper<float>::fromString(const String& str)\n{\n    float val = 0.0f;\n\n    if (str.empty())\n        return val;\n\n    //Some code here...\n\n    return val;\n}\n\ntemplate class PropertyHelper<float>;\n\n```\n\nThe last line is the explicit instantiation definition.\n\nSo my question is most of all if I did everything correctly here according to the C++11 standard and secondly (if first is true) if the \\_\\_declspec keyword is redundant in the context of the explicit instantiation declaration, or what I should do about it, as I did not find proper information in the MSDN docs.",
        "answer": "From the language definition \n\nA.12\nTemplates *[gram.temp]*\n\nAt the bottom we find the rules in question (sorry about the formatting):\n\n\u00a7 A.12\n1224c ISO/IEC\nN4527\n\n```\nexplicit-instantiation:\n    extern opt template declaration\nexplicit-specialization:\n    template < > declaration\n\n```\n\nSo I would say the answer to the 2nd question is that you shouldn't need the \\_\\_declspec for the `extern` declaration.\n\nAs for the first question I agree with Daveed V. above in that, according to the standard, the explicit declarations seem to be extraneous.

Conversly, on Little Endian systems, where LSB is first, is LSb also first?\n\nLAST EDIT: I found [this](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6788) which says \"**Bit order usually follows the same endianness as the byte order for a given computer system**\"",

More details in [Opt in to beta testing new themes](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314542/opt-in-to-beta-testing-new-themes)\n> \n> \n> \n\nIn the post entitled [Ch-ch-ch-changes: Left nav, responsive design, & themes](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/307862/ch-ch-ch-changes-left-nav-responsive-design-themes), I described a number of changes that are coming with the introduction of the left navigation bar. In addition to the navigation changes, we will be introducing responsive design and new theming across the Stack Exchange network of sites. See that post for the full details. This post will focus on updating the schedule for the release of these features and responding to some of the feedback from the previous post.\n\n> \n> When will the changes be coming?\n> ================================\n> \n> \n> **Current state** - Left navigation is on for anyone who is in a Stack Overflow team.\n> \n> \n> **Late April** - Finish core implementation, addressing early feedback, enable responsive design for Stack Overflow for Teams beta users.\n> \n> \n> **May** - Address bugs and critical feedback\n> \n> \n> **Early-June** - Sneak peak on MSE.

Outline process and timeline for sites without custom themes to get one.\n> \n> \n> **July and beyond** - Design, community review and deploy site themes to additional sites.\n> \n> \n> \n\nResponse to feedback\n====================\n\nWe received a lot of great feedback in the last post. Below I've summarized the major themes/issues raised, will provide a short response, and will tag each one ([status-planned](/questions/tagged/status-planned \"show questions tagged 'status-planned'\"), [status-review](/questions/tagged/status-review \"show questions tagged 'status-review'\"), [status-bydesign](/questions/tagged/status-bydesign \"show questions tagged 'status-bydesign'\"), [status-declined](/questions/tagged/status-declined \"show questions tagged 'status-declined'\"), etc.) to indicate how we will be proceeding. There is still research and design work to come up with a full solution for the issues we are going to address.\n\nLeft navigation bar\n-------------------\n\nWe are committed to the left nav, but based on your feedback we'll be addressing some key concerns.\n\n### [Hide/collapse left nav](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307866/354333) [status-completed](/questions/tagged/status-completed \"show questions tagged 'status-completed'\")\n\nOne of the biggest concerns was the amount of space that is taken up by the left nav. We're currently working on making the left nav collapsable. If you collapse it, then the left nav stays collapsed. When you click on the hamburger to access it the left nav comes up as an overlay and will dismiss when you make a choice or click away. Plan is that this will be remembered per site. For example you can keep it open on SO.com, but keep it collapsed on other sites.\n\n### Add more value in left nav [status-planned](/questions/tagged/status-planned \"show questions tagged 'status-planned'\")\n\nImplicit in much of the feedback was the idea that the left nav real estate is not delivering enough value per pixel. Based on the images we showed it was clear that for people who are not on SO.com or aren't in a team, the left nav is pretty empty. We have some great ideas for adding value here and have already started work on one. More specifics in an upcoming post.\n\n*A design exploration showing examples of features we could add/move to left nav.*\n\n[![Image of the left nav with shortcuts and favorite tags](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eFjBVl.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eFjBVl.jpg)\n\n### Resize the left nav [status-declined](/questions/tagged/status-declined \"show questions tagged 'status-declined'\")\n\nAnother idea mentioned was resizing the left nav to reduce the amount of space it takes. We looked at several models for this and didn't love any of them. Some of the best options require coming up with good iconography for each item and we know how much fun that is ([review queue](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/355236/the-new-review-icon-isnt-an-improvement) anyone?). Also, this is a lot more work than hide/collapse. So, we will start with hide/collapse first and evaluate how it works for everyone.\n\n### [Left nav vs. site selector](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307869/354333) [status-review](/questions/tagged/status-review \"show questions tagged 'status-review'\")\n\nMonica raised a great issue about the relationship of left nav and the site selector. We agree that there is room for improvement here. We looked at some models that attempted to merge the two, but we couldn't get it right. Also, it felt like a radical change. So, we are keeping this one on the back burner for now, but will likely come back to review it.\n\nNetwork site theming\n--------------------\n\n### [Who gets a new theme?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307922/354333) [status-planned](/questions/tagged/status-planned \"show questions tagged 'status-planned'\")\n\nSimple answer here is the Community team is working out the criteria for who (beyond graduated sites) will get themes. It's kinda silly that sites that have been around for years are still using the basic theme. One of the reasons for simplifying the theming is to enable more sites to get customized themes. Theming will still require support from TeamDAG for the forseeable future ([no self service theming](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307922/354333)) and it will take time for us to work through the full list of sites, but the goal is to get themes to all sites that have proved themselves viable.\n\n### [Fonts](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307865/354333) [status-completed](/questions/tagged/status-completed \"show questions tagged 'status-completed'\")\n\nCheck out the resolution to this issue here: [Fonts and the new Q&A theming](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/311033/fonts-and-the-new-qa-theming)\n\n### [Specialized (e.g. MathJax) content](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307864/354333) [status-planned](/questions/tagged/status-planned \"show questions tagged 'status-planned'\")\n\nThere are no plans to remove features to support specialized content. However, there may be special work to make it work well in a responsive design. That said, the goal is no change to the experience if your viewport is the same as today's min width and the left nav is hidden. On smaller viewports we will need to introduce a horizontal scrollbar if the custom elements can't be scaled down.\n\n### [Badges](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307870/354333) [status-planned](/questions/tagged/status-planned \"show questions tagged 'status-planned'\")\n\nPeople love their badges. This was the top voted feedback. We will support the current custom badges and will do our best to create new badges for new themes.\n\n### [Keep theming as it is today](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307884/354333) [status-bydesign](/questions/tagged/status-bydesign \"show questions tagged 'status-bydesign'\")\n\nUnsurprisingly, people also love their current themes and don't want to lose them. Given that highly themed sites are the minority and that the current theming level is unsustainable, we're going to have to disappoint here. In addition, things like voting and favorite buttons are a core part of the Q&A experience that should be shared across the network. It was a mistake that we ever allowed for those to be themed. So, while we will keep a more limited support for header graphics and colors, we won't be supporting the previous level of theming. The benefit is that most sites will have a theme, and theming for all sites will extend to the mobile experience. Of course, that is still strong medicine for the communities who have extensive themes under the old system.\n\nResponsive design\n-----------------\n\nMuch of the feedback around responsive design comes from our reliance on a video that shows a WIP and doesn't capture real world usage. You really need to use it. That said, there is no doubt we will get some stuff wrong when it goes live. We will work through issues as we identify them.\n\n### [Prioritize right column over left nav](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307867/354333) [status-review](/questions/tagged/status-review \"show questions tagged 'status-review'\")\n\nThe real answer on this one is \"kinda\". If you collapse the left nav, then we effectively prioritize things in the way Monica suggests. However, if the left nav is pinned, then we will continue prioritizing it over the right sidebar. We are also going to look at how we integrate sidebar content into the main content area. Some of it does need to be prioritized appropriately instead of just being dropped to the bottom of the page. Professional-advice disclaimer (see Health, Law, and Mi Yodeya) is a great example of this type of an issue.\n\n### [Don't squish the search bar into oblivion](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307876/354333) [status-completed](/questions/tagged/status-completed \"show questions tagged 'status-completed'\")\n\nWell, actually we completely squish it. Search bar drops to a search icon at narrow viewports. This lets us keep a full set of menus in place while supporting search.\n\nOther issues\n------------\n\n### [What about Area 51 and chat?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/307871/354333) [status-bydesign](/questions/tagged/status-bydesign \"show questions tagged 'status-bydesign'\")\n\nPoor Area 51 and chat (and SE.com to be honest). They never get the love. For now, they will stay as is. We simply don't have resources to address them. That said, there is so much the team would love to do here.\n\nAgain, thanks everyone for the feedback. I'll update the schedule above as we make progress or if any changes come up.",
        "answer": "Sticky Left Sidebar\n-------------------\n\nAt the moment the menu bar across the top is sticky, which is great if you get to the end of a long page and want to get back to home or something.\n\nThe left nav at the moment (in it's SO Teams iteration) scrolls with the page, which is ok at the moment, because there's not a lot in it. But as you go \"adding value\" to it I can see it becoming annoying to have to keep scrolling back up. So having it sticky would be great.\n\nIf it becomes longer than the page (especially if the SE sites selector gets added to it - I have a user on all the sites I think, so the \"My CommunitiesW bit would be quite large), then it should independently scroll - as in have it's own scrollbar.",

I've usually found I'd want to do that anyway though, to make the calling code clean.\n\nNote that `Wait` releases the monitor itself, then waits for the `Pulse`, then reacquires the monitor before returning.\n\nAs for using `ManualResetEvent` or `AutoResetEvent` instead - you could, but personally I prefer using the `Monitor` methods unless I need some of the other features of wait handles (such as atomically waiting for any/all of multiple handles).",

        "answer": "Symbols are sort of lightweight strings (though they are not strings). The `send()` and `method()` methods can take strings or symbols; one is converted to the other in the inner workings (not sure which) and then ruby executes the method with the matching name. Hence `A.send(:text)` is equivalent to `A.text()`. If you had a variable named `methodName = :text`, you could do `A.send(methodName)` but not `A.methodName()`.\n\nSymbols are not variables, so you can't assign a value to a symbol. In your example, the symbol `:s` is unrelated to the variable `s` (despite the fact that they have the same \"name\", preceding it with a colon makes it a symbol instead of a variable). You're assigning a string value to the variable `s` but telling it to print the symbol `:s`, which it does.",

Why the timeout? According to [`help read`](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/readh.html) (typing left unchanged; bold is mine):\n\n> \n> `-t timeout` time out and return failure if a complete line of input is\n>  not read withint `TIMEOUT` seconds. The value of the `TMOUT`\n>  variable is the default timeout. `TIMEOUT` may be a\n>  fractional number. **If `TIMEOUT` is 0, read returns success only\n>  if input is available on the specified file descriptor**.

As `-t` can take fractional values (according to above man page), changing read line to:\n\n```bsh\nread -d '' -t 0.01 myData;\n\n```\n\nactually reads the data when data is present and skips it (after 10ms timeout) if it is not. But it should also work when `TIMEOUT` is set to real `0`.\n\n**Why it actually doesn't?** How can this be fixed?

        "question": "The [**degree distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_distribution) of a graph is of main importance, especially for large graphs, and namely random graphs. Its expected value and its higher [moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)) tell a lot about a graph \u2013 but of course not everything.\n\nThe **distance distribution** $D(k)$ of a graph is possibly of equal importance. First determine for each vertex $i$ of the graph its distance distribution $d\\_i(k)$ giving the numbers of $k$-order neighbours ($1$-order neighbours being the immediate neighbours). Then calculate the normalized sums\n\n$$D(k) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\_{i=1}^N d\\_i(k)$$\n\nThe expected distance between two nodes is the expected value of this distribution. But the distribution has higher moments which may tell something interesting about the graph.\n\nMy impression is that the so-defined distance distribution (and no other definition comes to my mind) is roughly as informative as the degree distribution (even though in other respects), but in the literature it is significantly underrepresented:\n\n* Googling for [\"degree distribution\" \"graph theory\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22degree%20distribution%22%20%22graph%20theory%22) yields **180,000** results.\n* Googling for [\"distance distribution\" \"graph theory\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22distance%20distribution%22%20%22graph%20theory%22) yields only **10,000** results.\n* There is an extended article on [degree distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_distribution) on Wikipedia.\n* There is no article on [distance distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_distribution) on Wikipedia.\n\nHow can I understand this?\n\n---\n\nIn the following examples one can see that for regular graphs like Euclidean tilings (examples 1 to 4) the distance distributions look very much the same (even more than the degree distributions), but for the hyperbolic tiling $(3.4)^3$ and an Erd\u00f6s-Renyi graph, the distance distribution looks qualitatively different.\n\n[![![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/snPyr.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/snPyr.png)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VeTI2.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VeTI2.png)\n\nThe shades of green indicate node degrees.\n\n---\n\nFor some random graph distributions generated by the [configuration model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_model) (625 nodes, mean degree 4). A power-law distribution of node degree is to come.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZSru.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wZSru.png)",
        "answer": "I see several reasons why degree distributions may be preferred to distance distributions.\n\nFirst, **degrees are more robust** than distances, in the following sense: adding or removing one or a few links have a small impact on the degree distribution, whereas it may have a dramatic impact on distance distributions. In particular, adding a few random links (which may reflect erroneous measurements in practice) makes the average distance drop very quickly. This is one of the key principles underlying the [Watts and Strogatz model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts%E2%80%93Strogatz_model), by the way.\n\nSecond, in practice, computing degree distributions is trivial, whereas **computing distance distributions is costly**; it typically requires $O(n\\cdot m)$ time on graphs with $n$ nodes and $m$ links. This is often prohibitive. Approximations may help, but the problem remains much harder than degree distributions, and some values missed by the approximation may be important for the distribution.\n\nThird, as one may see in your examples, distance distributions are often quite centered around their mean, with few exceptions. Actually, as I said, adding just a few random links is often sufficient to obtain this effect. Instead, observed degree distributions often span several orders of magnitude, which may be seen as more informative: **degrees somehow make more difference between nodes than distances**.\n\nFinally, notice that distances make sense only between pairs of nodes **in the same connected components**. If the considered graphs are not connected, then it may be unclear how to interpret distance distributions.\n\nOne may also argue that sampling random graphs with prescribed degree distributions makes more sense (or is easier?) than sampling random graphs with prescribed distance distribution. This makes degree distributions more appealing both in practice, when one indeed generates random graphs, and in theory, as proving property of these random objects may be tractable.",

        "answer": "Global variables retain their value. In your case, if `flag` is global, once set to `0` (within `controlNumber`) it will keep that value. There is no other place in the code to make it `1` again.\n\nMaking it a local variable to the function will cause it to initialize to `1` every time the function is called.\n\n**Edit:** if you want to have it as global, you could set it to `1` every time `controlNumber` returns `0`, i.e., before or after `printf(\"not all digits are equal\\n\");`.",

        "answer": "> \n> I expect the result of\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> console.log(a && b);\n> \n> ```\n> \n> to be `false` and not `null` as it shown in the example.\n> \n> \n> \n\nIn many languages with `&&` and `||` operators (or `AND` and `OR`), the result is always a boolean, yes.\\* But JavaScript's `&&` and `||` are more useful than that: Their result is their left-hand operand's value or their right-hand operand's value, **not** coerced to boolean.\n\nHere's how `&&` works:\n\n1. Evaluate the left-hand operand.\n2. If the value is *falsey* (coerces to `false` when we make it a boolean), return the value (not the coerced value)\n3. If the value from #2 is *truthy*, evaluate and return the right-hand value (uncoerced)\n\nThe *falsey* values are `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `\"\"`, `NaN`, and of course, `false`. Everything else is *truthy*.\n\nSo for instance\n\n```\nconsole.log(0 && 'hi');    // 0\n\n```\n\n...shows `0` because `0` is falsey. Note it resulted in `0`, not `false`. Similarly, the result here:\n\n```\nconsole.log(1 && 'hello'); // hello\n\n```\n\n...is `'hello'` because the right-hand side isn't coerced at all by `&&`.\n\n`||` works similarly (I call it the [*curiously-powerful OR operator*](http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2008/02/javascripts-curiously-powerful-or.html)): It evaluates the left-hand side and, if that's *truthy*, takes that as its result; otherwise it evaluates the right-hand side and takes *that* as its result.\n\nThe only time you get `true` or `false` from `&&` or `||` is if the selected operand is *already* a boolean.\n\n---\n\n\\* Of course, many (but not all) of those languages (Java, C#) also require that the operands to `&&` and `||` already be booleans. C's an exception, it does some coercion, but still has the result of the operands as a boolean (or if you go back far enough, an int that will be 1 or 0).",

        "question": "I'm trying to understand how unit testing works. So far i understand you're testing the output of functions based on what you put in. Ok. Does that mean if your function has the only possibility of returning one datatype you only have to write one test for it? So say i write a function that only has the possibility of returning TRUE or FALSE, does that mean i would just be checking if the response is boolean? \n\nAnd then also say i have a function that is pulling posts from a blog from a database. Say have the function set to: if number of rows = 0 return FALSE, else return the results. So i now i have the possibility of a function that could return a boolean value or an array. How the heck do you test that? The function now doesn't rely solely on the input, it relies on what's in the database.",
        "answer": "A useful function does not return `true` or `false` randomly. It returns `true` *under certain circumstances* and `false` *under other circumstances*.\n\nA unit test would therefore do three things (in that order):\n\n1. Create an environment from which you know whether the function should return `true` or `false` (this environment is called the *test fixture*).\n2. Run the function that is to be tested.\n3. Compare the result of the function with you expectations.\n\nObviously this cannot be done with all possible inputs (if it could be done, this would be a proof, not a test), so the art of unit testing is choosing appropriate test fixtures. There are two ways to go about this:\n\n* *Black box testing* looks at the specification of the function to choose the fixtures: what are the valid input values and how should they influence the output?\n* *White box testing* looks into the function and chooses fixtures such that every statement of the function is executed by at least one fixture.\n\n> \n> ... if number of rows = 0 return FALSE, else return the results. \n> \n> \n> \n\nIf such a function directly sends a query to a database server by calling an API of the DBMS (e.g. `mysql_query`), the creation of the test fixture would include\n\n1. Setting up a database.\n2. Inserting rows into the database (or not, depending on whether the test should check that the results are returned properly or `FALSE` is returned properly).\n\nIf, on the other hand, that function calls a custom function (e.g. provided by an object-relational mapper), then the test fixture should provide a mock implementation of that custom function. Dependency injection helps to ensure lose coupling of caller and callee, so the real implementation can be replaced with the mock implementation at runtime.",

        "question": "I'm trying to use EF 4.3 migrations with multiple code-first DbContexts. My application is separated into several plugins, which possibly have their own DbContext regarding their domain. The application should use one single sql-database. \n\nWhen I try to auto migrate the contexts in an empty database, this is only successful for the first context. Every other context needs the AutomaticMigrationDataLossAllowed-Property set to true but then tries to drop the tables of the previous one. \n\nSo my question is: \n\n* How can I tell the migration-configuration just to look after the tables defined in their corresponding context and leave all others alone?\n* What is the right workflow to deal with multiple DbContexts with auto-migration in a single database?\n\nThank you!",
        "answer": "Here is what you can do. very simple.\n\nYou can create Configration Class for each of your context.\ne.g \n\n```\ninternal sealed class Configuration1 : DbMigrationsConfiguration<Context1>{\n   public Configuration1 (){\n        AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = false;\n        MigrationsNamespace = \"YourProject.Models.ContextNamespace1\";\n   }\n}\n\ninternal sealed class Configuration2 : DbMigrationsConfiguration<Context2>{\n   public Configuration2 (){\n        AutomaticMigrationsEnabled = false;\n        MigrationsNamespace = \"YourProject.Models.ContextNamespace2\";\n   }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow you add migration. You dont need to enable migration since you already did with the 2 classed above.\n\n```\nAdd-Migration -configuration Configuration1 Context1Init\n\n```\n\nThis will create migration script for context1. your can repeat this again for other Contexts.\n\n```\nAdd-Migration -configuration Configuration2 Context2Init\n\n```\n\nTo Update your database \n\n```\nUpdate-Database -configuration Configuration1\nUpdate-Database -configuration Configuration2\n\n```\n\nThis can be done in any order.

        "question": "The current system that I am working on makes use of Castle Activerecord to provide ORM (Object Relational Mapping) between the Domain objects and the database. This is all well and good and at most times actually works well!\n\nThe problem comes about with Castle Activerecords support for asynchronous execution, well, more specifically the SessionScope that manages the session that objects belong to. Long story short, bad stuff happens!\n\nWe are therefore looking for a way to easily convert (think automagically) from the Domain objects (who know that a DB exists and care) to the DTO object (who know nothing about the DB and care not for sessions, mapping attributes or all thing ORM).\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on doing this. For the start I am looking for a basic One to One mapping of object. Domain object **Person** will be mapped to say **PersonDTO**. I do not want to do this manually since it is a waste.\n\nObviously reflection comes to mind, but I am hoping with some of the better IT knowledge floating around this site that *\"cooler\"* will be suggested.\n\nOh, I am working in C#, the ORM objects as said before a mapped with Castle ActiveRecord.\n\n---\n\nExample code:\n-------------\n\nBy @ajmastrean's request I have [linked](http://www.fryhard.com/downloads/stackoverflow/ActiveRecordAsync.zip) to an example that I have (badly) mocked together. The example has a **capture form**, capture form **controller**, **domain** objects, activerecord **repository** and an **async** helper. It is slightly big (3MB) because I included the ActiveRecored dll's needed to get it running. You will need to create a database called *ActiveRecordAsync* on your local machine or just change the .config file.\n\nBasic details of example:\n\n**The Capture Form**\n\nThe capture form has a reference to the contoller\n\n```\nprivate CompanyCaptureController MyController { get; set; } \n\n```\n\nOn initialise of the form it calls MyController.Load()\n private void InitForm ()\n {\n MyController = new CompanyCaptureController(this);\n MyController.Load();\n }\nThis will return back to a method called LoadComplete()\n\n```\npublic void LoadCompleted (Company loadCompany)\n{\n    _context.Post(delegate\n    {\n         CurrentItem = loadCompany;\n         bindingSource.DataSource = CurrentItem;\n         bindingSource.ResetCurrentItem();\n         //TOTO: This line will thow the exception since the session scope used to fetch loadCompany is now gone.\n         grdEmployees.DataSource = loadCompany.Employees;\n         }, null);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nthis is where the *\"bad stuff\"* occurs, since we are using the child list of Company that is set as Lazy load.\n\n**The Controller**\n\nThe controller has a Load method that was called from the form, it then calls the Asyc helper to asynchronously call the LoadCompany method and then return to the Capture form's LoadComplete method.\n\n```\npublic void Load ()\n{\n    new AsyncListLoad<Company>().BeginLoad(LoadCompany, Form.LoadCompleted);\n}\n\n```\n\nThe LoadCompany() method simply makes use of the Repository to find a know company.\n\n```\npublic Company LoadCompany()\n{\n    return ActiveRecordRepository<Company>.Find(Setup.company.Identifier);\n}\n\n```\n\nThe rest of the example is rather generic, it has two domain classes which inherit from a base class, a setup file to instert some data and the repository to provide the **ActiveRecordMediator** abilities.",
        "answer": "I solved a problem very similar to this where I copied the data out of a lot of older web service contracts into WCF data contracts. I created a number of methods that had signatures like this:\n\n```\npublic static T ChangeType<S, T>(this S source) where T : class, new()\n\n```\n\nThe first time this method (or any of the other overloads) executes for two types, it looks at the properties of each type, and decides which ones exist in both based on name and type. It takes this 'member intersection' and uses the DynamicMethod class to emil the IL to copy the source type to the target type, then it caches the resulting delegate in a threadsafe static dictionary.\n\nOnce the delegate is created, it's obscenely fast and I have provided other overloads to pass in a delegate to copy over properties that don't match the intersection criteria:\n\n```\npublic static T ChangeType<S, T>(this S source, Action<S, T> additionalOperations) where T : class, new()\n\n```\n\n... so you could do this for your Person to PersonDTO example:\n\n```\nPerson p = new Person( /* set whatever */);\nPersonDTO = p.ChangeType<Person, PersonDTO>();\n\n```\n\nAnd any properties on both Person and PersonDTO (again, that have the same name and type) would be copied by a runtime emitted method and any subsequent calls would not have to be emitted, but would reuse the same emitted code *for those types in that order* (i.e. copying PersonDTO to Person would also incur a hit to emit the code).\n\nIt's too much code to post, but if you are interested I will make the effort to upload a sample to SkyDrive and post the link here.\n\nRichard",

I am all for using css styles as classes in a separate .css file. But every once in a while, i run into a scenario where i need just some padding for a particular element or change the css class' width only in one particular situation. Is it okay to add inline styles in those scenarios? do people do this or always create classes for everything.\n\nMy theory would be if its not something reusable or does not contain more than 2 styles, why create a class for it. Am I wrong in thinking that?\n\n**Summary of Answers** (since there are many)\n\nIt is better to avoid inline styles because\n\n1) style sheets provides more maintainability. \n\n2) better separation of html data and layout.\n\n3) re-usability of styles.\n\n4) probably provides better caching.\n\nOverall, css style sheet is the best practice.",
        "answer": "Anything is reusable if you think it through and set it up correctly. Even one-line, one element CSS attributes can be beneficial if reused. This takes advantage of the concept of caching, which will keep the css in memory after the initial load hit. No matter which way you slice it, inline styles add to your overhead every load without question.\n\nNever mind the fact that inline mixed with a proper css document adds overhead to your own debug time, figuring out where the darned calls are coming from.",

        "answer": "You're running against Racket's *phase separation* -- which means that each phase (the runtime and the compile-time) operate in different worlds. As Vijay notes, one way to solve this is to do what you want at runtime, but that will probably not be what you need in the long run. The thing is that trying these things usually means that you will want to store some syntactic information at the compile-time level. For example, say that you want to store the names of all of your defined names, to be used in a second macro that will print them all out. You would do this as follows (I'm using sane macros here, `define-macro` is a legacy hack that shouldn't be used for real work, you can look these things up in the [guide](http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/macros.html), and then in the [reference](http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/Macros.html)):\n\n```\n#lang racket\n(define-for-syntax defined-names '())\n(define-syntax (mydefine stx)\n  (syntax-case stx ()\n    [(_ name value)\n     (identifier? #'name)\n     (begin (set! defined-names (cons #'name defined-names))\n            #'(define name value))]\n    ;; provide the same syntactic sugar that `define' does\n    [(_ (name . args) . body)\n     #'(mydefine name (lambda args . body))]))\n\n```\n\nNote that `defined-names` is defined at the syntax level, which means that normal runtime code cannot refer to it. In fact, you can have it bound to a different value at the runtime level, since the two bindings are distinct. Now that that's done, you can write the macro that uses it -- even though `defined-names` is inaccessible at the runtime, it is a plain binding at the syntax level, so:\n\n```\n(define-syntax (show-definitions stx)\n  (syntax-case stx ()\n    [(_) (with-syntax ([(name ...) (reverse defined-names)])\n           #'(begin (printf \"The global values are:\\n\")\n                    (for ([sym (in-list '(name ...))]\n                          [val (in-list (list name ...))])\n                      (printf \"  ~s = ~s\\n\" sym val))))]))\n\n```",

This can get old quickly, and something doesn't feel right about making the end developer do this, so...\n\n**Is there any way that my library can fire/invoke the events/delegates from the main UI thread?**\n\nIn particular...\n\n1. Should I automatically \"detect\" the \"main\" thread to use?\n2. If not, should I require the end developer to call some (pseudo) `UseThisThreadForEvents()` method when the application starts so I can grab the target thread from that call?",
        "answer": "Your library could check the Target of each delegate in the event's invocation list, and marshal the call to the target thread if that target is ISynchronizeInvoke:\n\n```\nprivate void RaiseEventOnUIThread(Delegate theEvent, object[] args)\n{\n  foreach (Delegate d in theEvent.GetInvocationList())\n  {\n    ISynchronizeInvoke syncer = d.Target as ISynchronizeInvoke;\n    if (syncer == null)\n    {\n      d.DynamicInvoke(args);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n      syncer.BeginInvoke(d, args);  // cleanup omitted\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnother approach, which makes the threading contract more explicit, is to require clients of your library to pass in an ISynchronizeInvoke or SynchronizationContext for the thread on which they want you to raise events. This gives users of your library a bit more visibility and control than the \"secretly check the delegate target\" approach.\n\nIn regard to your second question, I would place the thread marshalling stuff within your OnXxx or whatever API the user code calls that could result in an event being raised.",

        "answer": "There are a few problems with your code:\n\nFirst, you are trying to use `sqlite_num_rows` on a PDO handle. [PDO](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php) is a database abstraction layer that works with many underlying database systems. `sqlite_num_rows` only works with handles from the [native SQLite extension](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.sqlite.php) in PHP. So you can't use `sqlite_num_rows` here.\n\nSecondly, `SELECT COUNT(*) ...` will always return 1 row, regardless of if there was a match found or not, for example:\n\n```\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS MyCount FROM Users WHERE Name = 'Jeff'\n\n```\n\nWill return a result set that looks something like this:\n\n```\n+---------+\n| MyCount |\n+---------+\n| 1       |\n+---------+\n\n```\n\nAssuming you have a row in the `Users` table that has the value `Jeff` in the `Name` column.\n\nIf, instead, you were to execute this:\n\n```\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS MyCount FROM Users WHERE Name = 'ThisDoesNotExist'\n\n```\n\nYou would get a result set that looked like:\n\n```\n+---------+\n| MyCount |\n+---------+\n| 0       |\n+---------+\n\n```\n\nSo you would still have 1 row, but the value of the `MyCount` column in the result set would tell you if a match was found or not. So even if you *could* use `sqlite_num_rows` here, it wouldn't help you because it would always return `1`.\n\nWhat you really want to do is check the value of `MyCount` in the result set, and if it is `1` then there was a match, and if it is a `0` there was not a match.\n\nKeep in mind that if there were multiple rows in your `Users` table that had the same `Name` and `Password` then `COUNT(*)` would return something the number of rows where that match occurred.\n\nThe following code should get you what you are looking for:\n\n```\n$existUser = false;\n\n//select records with username and password match\n$stmt = $db->prepare(\"SELECT COUNT(*) AS MyCount FROM Users WHERE Name = ? AND Password = ?\");\nif ($stmt->execute(array($incomingusername, $incomingpassword))) {\n    $rows = $stmt->fetchAll();\n\n    $existUser = ($rows[0]['MyCount'] == 1);\n}\n\nif ($existUser) {\n    /* Found a matching user */\n} else {\n    /* Did NOT find a matching user */\n}\n\n```\n\nThe side effect of this approach is that you are protected from [SQL injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).",

However,\n>  there is a crucial asymmetry between the good and the bad things.

(and this is not bad)\n\nSo, there\u2019s an asymmetry between good and bad that will always hangs on the side of bad things and \u201ccoming into existence is always a harm\u201d. It looks very powerful and sound. But we can also put (a) more like (b), this way:\n\nc) (3) If x will never be born, she can\u2019t experience the lack of bad things (and this is not bad).\n\nIf we put the same specific weight on \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d like he does, the asymmetry disappears. Later in the book he writes that\n\n> \n> the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom\n>  this absence is a deprivation.\n> \n> \n> \n\nBut we can also state that \"the absence of *pain* is not *good* unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a good thing\". Have I misunderstood?",
        "answer": "Yes, **it's wrong.** \n\nIf you think that the 'absence of pleasure' is merely 'not bad' then you are simply failing to imagine a pleasure which is equal in magnitude to your imagined pain. A standard-issue human brain might be evolutionary adept (and indeed in good tune) when conjuring this prejudiced mistake - as living in fear is an evolutionary stable strategy.\n\nBut if you imagine that the worst-worst might be merely losing a dollar, and the best-best might be simply finding a dollar (yay!), we can easily see that there is no difference between existing in a day where you 'lost-then-found a dollar' versus not existing in that day at all. If the two magnitudes are equal then there is no weight to the idea that not existing would be, in any way, 'better'.\n\nAnd that's a pity - because antinatalism can be more effortlessly justified on the basis that Darwinian life is a zero sum game. That is to say, if new life manages to win some pleasure in its competitive environment, somewhere a loser is surely paying the price in the natural currency of pain.",

Let $U$ be a topological ball to simplify matters. The following *tail volume condition* is necessary for the existence of such $p$.\n\n(TVC) $\\int\\_1^{\\infty} r^{m} |U\\setminus B(r)|=\\infty$ for some $m>0$. \n\nIndeed, the absolute value of the Jacobian of $p$ must have infinite integral over $U$. Since the Jacobian is a polynomial, $\\int\\_U |x|^N dx=\\infty$ for some $N$. The latter can be rephrased in terms of tail volume: $\\int\\_1^{\\infty} r^{N-1} |U\\setminus B(r)| =\\infty$. The example of $U=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb R^2\\colon x>1, 0<y<x^{-M}\\}$ shows that (TVC) is somewhat sharp. This particular $U$ can be mapped onto $\\mathbb R^2$ by $(x,y)\\mapsto (x,x^{M+1}y)$ followed by translation and the power map $(x+iy)\\mapsto (x+iy)^8$.\n\nI am interested in other obstructions besides small tail volume, as well as in reasonably general sufficient conditions. Initially I hoped to get a stronger necessary condition from an affirmative answer to the question below, but Bjorn Poonen answered it in the negative. \n\n\"If $f\\colon U\\to\\mathbb R^n$ is a polynomial surjection, does there exist $\\epsilon>0$ such that $p(U\\cap B(r))$ contains $B(r^\\epsilon)$ for large $r$?\"",
        "answer": "It is enough to construct a sequence of pairwise disjoint disks $D\\_j$ of infinite total volume so that the image $\\bigcup\\_j f(D\\_j)$ has $0$ density for any polynomial mapping $f:\\mathbb R^2\\to\\mathbb R^2$. Then you can connect them by very thin passageways to get a topological disk and add just a finite area to the image. \n\nThe idea is that near each point $x$ with $|x|=r$, the mapping $f$, either $|\\mbox{det}\\phantom{,}Df| < r^{-5}$, or $f$ is essentially linear in the square $Q$ with side length $r^{-M}$ centered at $x$ where $M$ depends on $f$ only and $f(Q)$ has diameter less than $1$. Now, we can create a locally finite covering of the entire plane with squares $Q$ such that the side length of each $Q$ is less than $e^{-|c(Q)|}$ where $c(Q)$ is the center of $Q$ and put into each square $Q$ a small disk $D$ whose area is o-small of the area of $Q$ as $c(Q)\\to\\infty$ (which doesn't contradict the infinite volume restriction). If we forget about the image of a large disk centered at the origin depending on $f$, and the image of those squares on which the determinant is small (both have finite area), then the remaining image is the union of small approximate ellipsoids inside much larger but still small approximate parallelograms. \n\nThe final observation is that each generic point can be covered by only $N=N(f)$ parallelograms (Bezout's theorem), so the total area of parallelograms intersecting a large disk is just a constant multiple of the area of that disk and the area of the corresponding ellipsoids is much smaller.\n\nThis formally answers Leonid's question about TVC but I'm not very happy with this bubble bath construction. So, let us ask whether there is a set containing sequence of disks of radii tending to $\\infty$ that cannot be mapped onto $\\mathbb R^2$ by a polynomial mapping.",

Nodes come in **[different types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeType)** (comment nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes and even text nodes). It may seem counter-intuitive that an element like `div` that doesn't have any nested elements that can contain text inside it actually does implicitly have a child element within it that contains the raw text and that element is a text node.\n\nIn order to access that (which will be separate from other elements within the `div`, you can navigate to the `div` and look for (in this case, it's **[`firstChild`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/firstChild)** because the text comes first and the image is second.\n\nAlso, when it comes to replacing the original text with something else...You were trying to call the `.replace()` string function on the `div` and not the text within the `div`.

        "answer": "It looks like you have configured your Git to use the command `more` as your *pager*. But the command `more` does not exist, so when Git tries to use it, that fails; the consequence is that your Git runs without a pager, as if you had run `git --no-pager branch` instead of just `git branch`.\n\n### Pagers\n\nThe concept of a *pager* goes back to the days of non-window-system computer terminals, that just showed, e.g., 24 lines of text at a time, typically with a maximum of 80 columns of ASCII or similarly restricted characters (nothing fancy like *\u00a1Hola!*, *\u00bfque?*). If you can only show 24 lines, but have 30 branch names to show, how will you deal with that?\n\nModern window systems have scroll-bars and the like, but we still exist in a world where showing one \"page\" of output at a time is useful. A pager will adapt text to fit your window, one page at a time. Popular pagers these days include `less`, which is like `more` but fancier (see its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(Unix))). A good pager can also search and highlight, which means that if any built in search and/or highlight of some command isn't good enough\u2014or is nonexistent\u2014just running that command's output through the pager augments the command so that it now has very fancy search and highlight.\n\nSome systems now come with a `more` program that is literally just a mode of `less`.

The way this is designed, it will break early once you've found a match, without searching any further. You can put your return false statement at the end of looping, because if you have checked the entire list without finding a match, clearly there is none.

        "answer": "Do what Henrik said in his second suggestion. But since these values seem to be used by people (else you wouldn't want to randomize them). Take one additional step. Multiply the sequential number by a large prime and reduce mod N where N is a power of 2. But choose N to be 2 bits smaller than you can store. Next, multiply the result by 11 and use that. So we have:\n\nHash = ((count \\* large\\_prime) % 536870912) \\* 11\n\nThe multiplication by 11 protects against most data entry errors - if any digit is typed wrong, the result will not be a multiple of 11. If any 2 digits are transposed, the result will not be a multiple of 11. So as a preliminary check of any value entered, you check if it's divisible by 11 before even looking in the database.",

Can electrons travel through an electrolytic solution?\n\nImagine a galvanic cell, without the wiring between the two electrodes and instead we only have the salt bridge. Won't the electrons (although it is very unfavorable to happen) travel through the salt bridge and the solutions? In other terms will the transformation of the electrodes occur?",
        "answer": "You're questioning the intuitive disconnect caused by most galvanic cell drawings which seem to assume the electrolyte solution in the salt bridge does not conduct electricity, so let's investigate.\n\nImagine a Zn/Cu$^{2+}$ cell with electrodes 5 cm apart in a 3.5% NaCl solution with a tube (1 cm$^2$ cross-section) of solution as the salt bridge for balancing charge.\n\nThe electrical resistance (R = $\\rho$l/A) of our NaCl 0.05 m x 1 cm$^2$ salt bridge solution is: \n\n$$\\frac{0.2 \\ ohms\\*m}{} \\* \\frac{0.05 \\ \\* m \\ (length)}{10^{-4}m^2 \\ (cross-section \\ area)}= 100 \\ ohms$$\n\nConsidering the predicted EMF of 1.1 Volts for this cell, the expected current ($I = V/R$) through the salt bridge is: $1.1V/100 \\ ohms \\ = 0.011 \\ amps$\n\nThis current may be negligible in a galvanic cell drawing compared to the current through some wire or low-resistance load. However, this would make a terrible battery for most common purposes as a typical AA battery (3000 mAh) would go completely dead in less than 2 weeks if it actually leaked at this rate!\n\nIt seems then your intuition is basically right... until you understand what the models leave out. In real alkaline battery designs, the cathode, electrolyte, and anode are sandwiched together very closely with a very large surface area, yielding excellent conductivity through electrolyte (and therefore very low resistance). However, these layers are separated by a membrane which allows ions through but has a very high resistance to electric current.\n\nSources:\n<https://www.thoughtco.com/table-of-electrical-resistivity-conductivity-608499> (seawater resistance)\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_battery> (alkaline battery design)",

Is there any reason why it has been designed like that for a 11 year old girl?\n\nIn [the second trailer,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MC3XuMvsDI) we see that the emotions inside the mother are all female, while the ones inside the father are all male. On top of that, while each emotion (Anger, Joy, etc) look alike from person to person, all the emotions inside the mother and the father look like them (The mother's emotions all have her same haircut & glasses, the father's have his haircut & mustache).\n\nIs there a in world or out of universe explanation for the mix & match look of Riley's emotions?\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tc2rD.jpg)",
        "answer": "The reasons of comedy and drama, as described by Word of God in cde's answer, are clearly the most important. Diverse cast of Riley's emotions makes the movie more interesting.\n\nI would like to add three complementary points no one else mentioned:\n\n**1. Sexism**\n\nOnce we assume that all emotions in one's head must have [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) and it must be similar to person's [assigned gender](http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Assigned_Sex), we start slipping into deep sexist swamp where only \"Woman's Tears\", \"Man's Rage\" and other non-objective abominations dwell.\n\nFortunately, Inside Out is far from being sexist. While Riley has some stereotypical \"girlish\" traits, they are affectionately deconstructed all the time. Moreover, Riley is shown as a plucky, independent girl: she plays hockey, talks back to her parents, and her inner life is not limited to Imaginary Boyfriend Machine.\n\n**2. Family**\n\nNote that Riley's Sadness looks like a daughter of mom's Sadness, and Riley's Anger is a younger version of dad's Anger, sans the moustache. It can emphasize the fact that Riley has inherited the traits of both of her parents. Her dad taught her how to be fair and assertive, and her mom taught her how to understand other people.\n\n**3. Main vs supporting emotions**\n\nWhile Riley has all kinds of \"men\", \"women\" and \"monsters\" in her head, her two most important emotions are Joy and Sadness, who are \"female\". They are her avatars in her inner journey; and the three remaining emotions, Fear, Anger and Disgust, serve their role only in *specific* situations (eating broccoli, playing hockey, dealing with electric cables). Their attempt to drive Riley for a prolonged period of time was a desperate measure and almost led to a disaster.\n\nIt's arguably easy to imagine \"female\" Fear and \"male\" Disgust, or even \"female\" Anger similar to mom's. But imagine for a second that either Joy or Sadness is \"male\". Or even both. That would raise *a lot* more questions.\n\nSo, while diversity is respected and silly gender stereotypes are mocked, Riley is still a vanilla [cisgender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender) girl. She is not exactly an old-style Disney princess, but on the other hand she is not [an asexual introvert](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/), or a [crossdresser](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120762/), or [into hairy guys](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/).

I can ask for timestamps on the `temperatures.csv` files itself (not the current approach) but I feel I should be able to handle this on my side.\n\nWould it be more efficient to only look for dirs that have target\\_date? and then build the paths so that it's only looking at the first level on each target\\_date dir?

        "question": "Choice of launcher seems to be an early decision in the design of spacecrafts. There would be an advantage to having the option to easily change launcher, especially for an interplanetary mission with a rarely recurring launch window, in case the intended launcher is grounded for a long time. A mission prepared to deal with an emergency, such as a space tug to save a failed orbital insertion of a crewed or otherwise valuable spacecraft, or for last-minute deflection of an asteroid, would also benefit from being able to launch from any out of several frequently launched rocket types (replacing the payload of the next one prepared to go).\n\nThe most frequently launched rockets nowadays are Atlas V, Falcon 9, Ariane 5 and Proton (assuming that Soyuz is too feeble). Incidentally, two of them have been grounded for 4 and 7 months now.\n\n* Could one design a spacecraft to go with at least three out of these four?\n* Would it need a bulky adapter stage?\n* Could one make adapters that could take almost any satellite or spacecraft on any of the launchers? (To steal the competitors' customers)\n* Proton is horizontally integrated, the others vertically. Is that outright disqualifying for inter-launcher payload compatibility?\n\nI suppose one \"could\", and that it comes down to how much would it would cost in mass and extra engineering. If it would be cheaper to have a dedicated launcher on some level of standby instead.\n\nDelta IV and the Japanese H-IIB are AFAIK both based on Delta, so they might be quite compatible. However, they are the most expensive launchers and do not launch very often.",
        "answer": "The physical adapter is the easy part. These have standard dimensions. Commercial launch providers were quick to realize it'd be advantageous to offer compatibility. E.g. the Ariane 5 payload fairing dimensions were based on the Shuttle payload bay. \n\nLooking at the user manuals for various launchers, you can see the differences: \n\n* vibration and other environmental factors (a satellite has to be tested and qualified for the launcher environment, so you have to budget for more tests)\n* maybe: electrical interfaces, although there are commonalities here too, for example the Ariane 5 and Falcon 9 use the same electrical connectors between launcher and satellite. I haven't had time yet to do a thorough comparison.\n\nSo provisionally: yes, you should be able to design a payload that's compatible with multiple rockets, without too much of a mass penalty.",

Look at the boilerplate below:\n\n```\nvoid *tdispatch(void *p) {\n      int to[2], from[2];\n      pipe(to);\n      pipe(from);\n      if (fork() == 0) {\n          ...\n      } else {\n          ...\n          pthread_exit(0); \n     }\n}\n...\nfor (int i = 0; i < NCPU; i++) {\n    pthread_create(..., tdispatch, ...);\n}\nfor (int i = 0; i < NCPU; i++) {\n    pthread_join(...);\n}\n\n```\n\nMultiple instances of tdispatch can interleave the pipe(to), pipe(from), and fork() calls; thus fds are leaking into these fork'ed processes. I say leaking because the forked'd process has no idea that they are there.\n\nA pipe continues to respond to read() system calls while it either has buffered data or there is at least one write file descriptor open to it.\n\nSuppose process 5 has its normal two ends of two pipes open, pointing to pipe#10, and pipe#11; and process 6 has pipe#12 and pipe#13. But, owing to the leaking above, processes 5 also has the write end of pipe#12, and process 6 has the write end of pipe#10. Process's 5 and 6 will never exit because they are keeping each others read-pipe's open.\n\nThe solution is pretty much what people in the earlier bit were saying: threads and forks are a tricky combination. You would have to serialize your pipe,fork,initial-close bits in order to make it work.",

        "question": "I'm still struggling with what must be basic (and resolved) issues related to CQRS style architecture:\n\nHow do we implement business rules that rely on **a set** of Aggregate Roots?\n\nTake, as an example, a booking application. It may enable you to book tickets for a concert, seats for a movie or a table at a restaurant. In all cases, there's only going to be **a limited number** of 'items' for sale.\n\nLet's imagine that the event or place is very popular. When sales open for a new event or time slot, reservations start to arrive very quickly - perhaps many per second.\n\nOn the query side we can scale massively, and reservations are put on a queue to be handled asynchronously by an autonomous component. At first, when we pull off Reservation Commands from the queue we will accept them, but at a certain time we will have to start **rejecting the rest**.\n\nHow do we know when we reach the limit?\n\nFor each Reservation Command we would have to query some sort of store to figure out if we can accommodate the request. This means that we will need to know how many reservations we have already received at that time.\n\nHowever, if the Domain Store is a non-relational data store such as e.g. Windows Azure Table Storage, we can't very well do a `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ...`\n\nOne option would be to keep a **separate Aggregate Root** that simply keeps track of the current count, like this:\n\n* AR: Reservation (who? how many?)\n* AR: Event/Time slot/Date (aggregate count)\n\nThe second Aggregate Root would be a denormalized aggregation of the first one, but when the underlying data store doesn't support transactions, then it's very likely that these can get out of sync in high-volume scenarios (which is what we are trying to address in the first place).\n\nOne possible solution is to **serialize** handling of the Reservation Commands so that only one at a time is handled, but this goes against our goals of scalability (and redundancy).\n\nSuch scenarios remind me of standard \"out of stock\" scenarios, but the difference is that we can't very well put the reservation on back order. Once an event is sold out, it's sold out, so I can't see what a compensating action would be.\n\nHow do we handle such scenarios?",
        "answer": "After thinking about this for some time it finally dawned on me that the underlying problem is less related to CQRS than it is to the **non-trasactional** nature of disparate REST services.\n\nReally it boils down to this problem: if you need to update several resources, how do you ensure consistency if the second write operation fails?\n\nLet's imagine that we want to write updates to Resource A and Resource B in sequence.\n\n1. Resource A is successfully updated\n2. The attempt to update Resource B fails\n\nThe first write operation can't easily be rolled back in the face of an exception, so what can we do? Catching and suppressing the exception to perform a compensating action against Resource A is not a viable option. First of all it's complex to implement, but secondly it's not safe: what happens if the first exception happened because of a failed network connection? In that scenario, we can't write a compensating action against Resource A either.\n\nThe key lies in explicit **idempotency**. While Windows Azure Queues don't guarantee **exactly once** semantics, they do guarantee **at least once** semantics. This means that in the face of intermittent exceptions, the message will later be **replayed**.\n\nIn the previous scenario, this is what happens then:\n\n1. Resource A is attempted updated. However, the replay is detected so the state of A isn't affected. However, the 'write' operation succeeds.\n2. Resource B is successfully updated.\n\nWhen all write operations are idempotent, **eventual consistency** can be achieved with **message replays**.",

        "question": "I completed this website 4 months ago. (I would like to keep the website anonymous - if this post comes up on google search by customers, it will have a negative impact on their business). We did several iterations, the client was very demanding (and nosy), I complied with every single thing that was wanted, including the font-size of the footer which destroyed the aesthetic looks by quite a bit; (and they messed with the colours too, making it look dangerously childish and unprofessional). \n\nAnyway, the client was very friendly during the whole process. After getting all the requirements I accepted to build the website for \u00a3950 and I charged him \u00a3150 in advance so he wouldn't want to bail out after I started the work. The requirements kept changing quite a lot, I made adjustments as and completed the website just 5 days late, w.r.t. the agreed date, in-spite all the changes in requirements.\n\nThat was four months ago. They have never returned my calls nor replied to my emails since then. How do I get the money back from them? I really need some advice on this, this is the second time someone has not paid me.\n\n### Points to be noted:\n\n1. We did not sign any contract - the client was a friend of a friend.\n2. I still hold the passwords for ftp, cpanel and everything. I don't want to bring the site down; somehow it doesn't seem ethical to me.\n3. I posted this on Stack Overflow and it was closed, I was redirected here.\n\n**EDIT**  \n\nThank you everyone, for your enormous support. I thought I should include some more details: The client is hosting the site; as in, I made them register and use their own debit card to buy the domain name, webspace and everything, I just have the passwords for his cpanel, and ftp (well, I have access to cpanel that pretty much gives me access to many things). \n\nNow, if I give them a warning, he might change the password to cpanel, but I am fairly sure they doesn't know about ftp's.\n\n**UPDATE**  \n\nI followed `Anna Lear`'s advice and sent the final invoice, on Saturday, with a warning that I will take the site down if he doesn't respond to my email before this Tuesday. They havn't replied to my emails yet, but I will let you know how this goes. Thanks much for your support. I plan to put up a holding page as `Darknight` suggested after Tuesday.\n\n**Points**  \n\nI don't have a server space of my own, however I have few web spaces of my clients but I don't want to use them for this kind of purpose.\n\n**RESULTS**  \n\nAfter my follow up of final invoice and warning, the client refused to anything. [workman's advice](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/23404/how-to-get-money-from-reluctant-client/23580#23580) seemed to be the most sensible to me. I mirrored the site to my own webspace, logged into his CPanel and forwarded the website to my site. Once that was done, I put up a holding page on my site so anyone going to the website would see a holdup page (nothing fishy, just an Under Construction page). Of course, this was all very weak in the sense that if my client knew about CPanel he could just remove the redirection. But, I had this second chance to get back to him and I was relying on him not knowing anything. \n\nTwo hours later, I got a call from the said client, (and acting as if they did not get any of my voice mails or emails) and asked me to get the site back up. I, of-course, said I had to be paid and two days after that I received a bank transfer. The site's back up and running now. \n\nJust wanted to say thank you all very much, I was very desperate when I had started this question. You are the best, not only you told me to learn the lesson (which I did) you also gave me a very very good solution that seemed to be very ethical (almost) to me. \n\nA BIG thank you to workman! \n\n---\n\nIf I could choose more than once answer, I would have chosen `Anna Lear` too, but since I followed workman's advice I had to pick that up. People who made a point about not taking the site down without consulting a lawyer, thanks a lot.",
        "answer": "You could send notice of pending legal action. If that doesn't make him pay, you would have to follow through and hire a lawyer. You could try debt collection or putting a lien on his business as well, but those might be difficult absent a contract. \n\nIf your friend was unable to appeal to him, they might know members of his family that you could contact to see if they could persuade him to pay.\n\nTo prevent this from happening again in the future, I'd suggest the following:\n\n1. **Always** use a contract, even for close friends or family members.\n2. Require a deposit (usually 50% up\nfront).\n3. Set the finished website up on\n*your* test server so that they can use it live and suggest any changes.\nOnce they approve of everything,\nsend them a final invoice. Once the\nremainder of the money has been\nreceived, transfer everything to\ntheir server.",

Next time I run the program however, the data that I added to the lists is gone. I am aware of a question nearly the same as this one, however, I couldn't make sense of the answers because I am very new to python. I'm aware of the pickle module, but I do not understand what it does. If using pickle is my best option, please explain how it works.",
        "answer": "If all you have is a list of some simple type like integers, `pickle` is overkill. You can just write each integer to a line, like this:\n\n```\nwith open('myfile.txt', 'w') as f:\n    for value in values:\n        f.write('{}\\n'.format(value))\n\n```\n\nThen, to read it back in:\n\n```\nvalues = []\nwith open('myfile.txt') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        values.append(int(line))\n\n```\n\nObviously this won't work if you're trying to save strings that might have newlines in them, or more complex data types that are harder to parse than just calling `int`. In that case, you may want to look at JSON, YAML, or Pickle formats.\n\nThe tutorial has a great chapter on [Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) that covers this, and a lot more (although it assumes you've read the previous chapters, or gotten the equivalent information elsewhere, or are willing to go back and read what you've missed if you get confused).",

When working with other developers, I typically find that\n\n* I don't like their formatting or conventions (such as variable or method names)\n* I don't have a good understanding of how the code they wrote works, which I would have if I wrote it myself\n* I think there is a better or more efficient way to implement something they wrote\n\nWhat are the best ways to overcome these issues and any other similar team issues for a project with 4-5 programmers?",
        "answer": "I have thought about these questions myself for awhile now. I am a team lead and am working with 2 other programmers. One of the programmers has a very similar style to myself - not the same, but close enough. I don't feel it warrants any changes on his part. What is the point of starting something for the sake of different tabbing conventions or variable names.\n\nThe other developer is a c programmer (we are vb.net programmers working on a .net project). He writes vb code as if it were c code (I suppose if the roles were reversed, we would write c code as if it were vb). I had some issues with this. But after I thought about it for awhile. The issues I had were really just an uncomfortable feeling that strange looking code gave me. There was really nothing wrong with his code. His code is clean and works very well. Besides, the code will be abstracted behind the class interface that he exposes to the rest of the program. So in the end the coding style doesn't really matter for us. As long as the program is correct and the comments are reasonable. We are all smart enough (at least I hope), that debugging shouldn't be that difficult.\n\nNow it would be a different story if he was coding in c# and we were coding in vb.net. We could still manage, but it would be more difficult.\n\nPersonally I think it is much more important that the individual team members use a coding convention that they are happy and comfortable with. This will mean that they are productively coding instead of referring to some style guide that tells them how many tabs they need to indent a function.\n\nThat doesn't mean that they are free to do as they wish with the application use cases or requirements - they are set by the customers.",

The heat flux on an Earth surface perpendicular to sun rays (i.e., the solar constant), is roughly 1.36 kilowatts per square meter. Is this simply the integral of the above distribution?\n2. Why is the sun approximated as a black body at 5800 K? Does this mean that the surface of the sun which is emitting radiation has a temperature of 5800 K? That seems kind of low.\n3. Is solar radiation approximated as a black body at 5800 K only on Earth, or is it the same everywhere? Why don't atmospheric effects and scattering change measurements of the solar spectrum on Earth?\n\n**EDIT:** \nThe solar constant is approximated by considering the Stefan-Boltzmann law (i.e., the integration of the spectral solar emission), the size of the sun, and the distance from the sun to Earth.

        "answer": "As a complement to the other answers, I'd like to point out that if you measure the solar spectrum at a very high resolution, you see very large variations in spectral radiance over very short wavelength scales. Here is a figure that I made for my PhD thesis to illustrate this:\n\n[![High resolution solar spectrum](https://i.stack.imgur.com/afXXl.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/afXXl.png)\n\nA high resolution solar spectrum ([source here](http://kurucz.harvard.edu/sun.html)) is plotted in grey and the same spectrum with degraded resolution is plotted in black. The lower panels show close-ups of smaller wavelength regions. This is the solar spectrum as seen from space, i.e. there are no effects from Earth's atmosphere present.\n\nThese variations are due to a multitude of absorption lines (normally referred to as [Fraunhofer lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines)) caused by absorption from gases in the colder outer parts of the [photosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere) (and to some extent in the [chromosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosphere)).\n\nHence, the ~5800 K black body spectrum is not a good description of the solar spectrum at very fine wavelength scales.

What if you have a dynamic number of input\n>  fields?\n> \n> \n> \n\ndoes not concern the number of users, which doesn't have to be fixed, rather it concerns the fact that that the properties of the object is differing, which I don't believe is your case. So, if your *DUser* has a property *userName*, and e.g. your *Project* has a property *name*. Your controller method could simply be, \n\n```\n@RequestMapping(value = \"/test\", method=RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String processSubmit(CreateProjectFormModel createProjectFormModel) {\n       ...\n}\n\n```\n\nand your form \n\n```\n<form:form action=\"/form/test\" method=\"post\">\n    <div class=\"single\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"project.name\"/>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"users[0].userName\"/>\n        <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"addNewUserInputSection();return false\">add another user</a>\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Save\">\n    </div>\n</form:form>\n\n```\n\nwhere you will have to provide some effort is to create a javascript function *addNewUserInputSection* that will add new set of input fields for the *users* property with an incremented index, e.g.\n\n```\n<form:form action=\"/form/test\" method=\"post\">\n    <div class=\"single\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"project.name\"/>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"users[0].userName\"/>\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"users[1].userName\"/>\n        <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"addNewUserInputSection();return false\">add another user</a>\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Save\">\n    </div>\n</form:form>\n\n```\n\nthe examples are basic, but should be enough to have you resolve your issue",

I am working on a project trying to map the displacement of a particle in the environment. I have already manipulated all the data so it's all down to estetics. \nSo basically I have two matrices 12 by 19 by 15, in which the coordinates (lat, long) of the particles are and the third dimension are timesteps. So the location of a particle changes through time. Now I wish to plot this in a way that at the first time step each element (so 12 by 19 although there are quite a few zeros and NaNs in the array) has it's own color that doesn't change in the next time step. This way you could track the movement of the particle. Note that I am operating with two matrices (one for latitude and the other for longitude, giving the location of the particle). So the plotting looks something like this\n\n```\nfor it=1:nt\n    plot(lat(:,:,it), long(:,:,it), 's'); hold on; \nend\n\n```\n\nIt would also be nice if a connector line would be drawn in each succesive time step between the previous location and the new one. \n\nI am having problems with this because when I assign the color in `plot()` all the elements get their own color. Also when I try to draw lines, all elements in a time step get connected to each other and it's all just a big mess. I can do for only one particle, but if I introduce many it doesn't work.",

The application will be used by thousands of small, autonomous non-profit organizations. \nThe data for each organization will need only a few (4 or 5) tables. The largest table for the largest organization will contain no more than 3000 rows; the largest table for the average organization will contain about 200 rows.\n\nEach organization will need to access its data daily, but the number of transactions will be limited. It is possible (but not likely) that many organizations \u2013 perhaps hundreds \u2013 will need access to the data at the same time. Only one person at each organization will need access to the data.\n\nData storage costs are extremely important \u2013 these are small non-profits with minimal funding.\nThe data will be accessed from a C# Silverlight app.\n\nI am open to any solution; I\u2019m not locked into using a traditional database.\n\nThis is a one-man, part time project without time sensitivity. I do not have access to database or cloud specialists; although I\u2019m an experienced developer I have little database and no cloud experience.\n\nAgain, storage costs must be kept to an absolute minimum, ideally no more than few dollars per organization per year.\n\nCan you suggest how I might accomplish this?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "question": "I've been using SVN for some time now, and am pretty happy with how it works (but I can't say I'm an expert, and I haven't really done much with branches and merging). However an opportunity has arisen to put in some new practises on a new team and so I thought I'd take a look at DVCSs to see if it's worth making the jump.\n\nThe company I work for is a pretty standard company where we all work in the same location (or sometimes at home) and we want to keep a central store of all code.\n\nMy question is: if all you are doing with a DVCS is creating a central hub that everyone pushes their changes to, is there really any benefit to moving to a DVCS and its extra overheads in this sort of environment?",
        "answer": "Personally, I find it's a huge benefit. Even with a central repo, a DVCS changes the flow from \"edit code, update from central, commit\" to \"edit code, commit, push to central\". Among other things, that means that conflict resolution is far less stressful. It can also encourage development in smaller chunks, since you don't have to push after every commit. If your team is OK with it, that means your individual commits might leave the app in a strange state, as long as it's working when you finally push to the central repo. If they're not OK with that, as long as you're using `git` (or [patch queues](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension) for `hg`, IIRC), you can still do dev in the same style, but then condense all your smaller commits into one larger commit that is complete before you push it to the central repo.",

        "question": "I have an application in one of my application pools that has a virtual path of `/Site/login.aspx`. I want to remove it but it no longer exists on my computer and it's causing me issues setting up AppFabric.\n\nI understand that you can remove these phantom applications by recreating the application in IIS and then hitting Remove. That will get rid of the application from the pool but in this case I can't recreate the application due to the `/login.aspx` in the virtual path\n\nAny ideas how I remove this erroneous entry?",
        "answer": "Since I had the same issue; application pools with applications that did not exist anymore, I did some research and finally managed to solve the issue.\n\nHere are some steps:\n\n1. Locate and edit your IIS 7 configuration file \"applicationHost.config\" with a text editor. It should be stored in \"*C:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\config*\" Since the folder is somehow \"protected\", I usually edit like the following:\n\t1. Open Windows Explorer\n\t2. Navigate to \"C:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\config\"\n\t3. Copy the file \"applicationHost.config\"\n\t4. Paste it to a folder where you can edit it, e.g. your Desktop\n\t5. Open it with your editor of choise and edit it\n\t6. Copy it back with Windows Explorer to \"C:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\config\"\n2. **Make a backup of your \"applicationHost.config\" file!**\n3. Search with a text editor in your \"applicationHost.config\" for your non-existing applications. They should be located somewhere inside an `<application ...>` XML node.\n4. Delete the `<application ...>` node(s) of all your phantom applications.\n5. Save the file and copy it back to \"C:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\config\"\n6. Refresh the IIS management console. Your application pools should now be without the phantom applications you previously deleted.\n7. Actually remove the now empty application pool.\n\nThat worked for me, if it does not work for you, please post a comment here. A good help was [this posting on the IIS forum](http://forums.iis.net/p/1164104/1930831.aspx#1930831).\n\nPlease be also aware that when editing the \"applicationHost.config\" file directly in its original location, you need to use a 64-bit editor (e.g. Notepad++ 64-bit), because otherwise it [would get stored in \"C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\inetsrv\\Config\" instead of the correct location](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/topic/11482/need-64-bit-version-of-notepad-to-edit-applicationhost-config-file-in-any-64-bit-version-of-iis).",

The perfect secrecy means that an attacker who obtains a ciphertext has no \"hint\" about what the plaintext may be: for example if an attacker obtains the ciphertext $C$, it could be the result of encrypting the plaintext $a$ with the key $3$, or the plaintext $b$ with the key $2$, or the plaintext $c$ with the key $1$, or the plaintext $d$ with the key $4$, and all those cases will occur with probability $1/4$. By comparison, the following cryptosystem:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c|c c c c}\n& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\na & A & A & C & D \\\\\nb & B & C & D & A \\\\\nc & C & D & A & B \\\\\nd & D & B & B & C\n\\end{array}$$\n\ndoes not have perfect secrecy because if an attacker obtains the ciphertext $A$, he knows that the plaintext is not $d$, and it is also more likely that the plaintext is $a$ (which is the case with probability $1/2$) than $b$ or $c$ (probability $1/4$ each).\n\nOn the other hand, with the following cryptosystem with keyspace $\\mathcal{K}' = \\{1,2,3\\}$:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{c|c c c c}\n& 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\na & A & B & C \\\\\nb & B & C & D \\\\\nc & C & D & A \\\\\nd & D & A & B\n\\end{array}$$\n\nan attacker obtaining the ciphertext $A$ knows that the plaintext is *not* $b$, so this system does not have perfect secrecy either, and it is easily seen that any cryptosystem with fewer keys than plaintexts will have the same problem.",

        "question": "I want to include a file and a variable within all my routes e.g.\n\n```\n$app->get('/', function() use ($app) {\n\n$auth='code';\nrequire __DIR__.'/assets/helpers.php';\n\n....\n\n});\n\n$app->get('login', function() use ($app) {\n\n$auth='code';    \nrequire __DIR__.'/assets/helpers.php';\n\n....\n\n});\n\n```\n\nI need to repeat the code on every route declaration. Putting the variable or redirect at the top of the file does not include it within the `$app` scope, even when setting `global $auth;`",
        "answer": "This is probably best accomplished with [route middleware](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/middlewares.html#route-middlewares):\n\n```\nuse Silex\\Application;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request;\n\n$app = new Application();\n\n$setup = function (Request $request) use ($app) {\n    $auth='code';\n    require __DIR__.'/assets/helpers.php';\n};\n\n$app->get('/', function() use ($app) {})\n    ->before($setup);\n\n$app->get('/login', function() use ($app) {})\n    ->before($setup);\n\n```\n\nThe only thing I am not sure of here is if this will cause scope issues for you. For example if you helpers depend on some other variable that might be established inside your controller closure then that might not work. But at that point I think it's kind of a bad smell in design and you should probably be abstracting those things into [Service Providers](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers.html).",

This is the wrong way of doing it. In fact, the switch will be equivalent to an `if/else if/else`.\n\nFor example :\n\n```js\nconst number = 1;\nswitch(number){\n   case \"1\":\n      console.log(\"odd\")\n      break;\n   case \"2\":\n      console.log(\"even\")\n      break;\n   default:\n      console.log('something else')\n      break;\n}\n\n```\n\nis equivalent to\n\n```\nconst number = 1;\nif(number === 1){\n  console.log(\"odd\")\n} else if (number === 2){\n  console.log(\"even\")\n} else {\n  console.log('something else')\n}\n\n```\n\n---\n\nIn your case, i thing you're looking for this :\n\n```js\nconst takeInput = prompt(\"Enter the Season Name : \");\nlet seasons = {\n  summer: [\"may\", \"june\", \"july\"],\n  winter: [\"november\", \"december\", \"january\"],\n};\n\nswitch (takeInput.toLowerCase()) {\n  case \"summer\":\n    console.log(\"summers\");\n    console.log(\"month\", seasons.summer)\n    break;\n}\n```\n\nNote : If you want to find the season by month. You can do it like this :\n\n```js\nconst takeInput = prompt(\"Enter the Month Name : \");\nlet seasons = {\n  summer: [\"may\", \"june\", \"july\"],\n  winter: [\"november\", \"december\", \"january\"],\n};\n\nObject.entries(seasons).forEach(([key, value]) => {\n  if(value.includes(takeInput.toLowerCase())) console.log(key)\n})\n```",

I've used SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for many years to do my database development without issue.\n\n* Why should I bother with VS2010 when SSMS works for me? What, specifically, does it do better than SSMS?\n* But perhaps my premise is incorrect and SSMS still trumps VS for database development. If so, in what specific ways is that true?",
        "answer": "There is no best practice, but with VS 2010 database project and source code controller (VSS 2010, Subversion, etc.) you can version your database.\n\nI recommend that you first design your database directly into SSMS. After your database is almost ready, import it into a VS 2010 database project. Once the import is done, you must always add new script into your database project to keep track of all modifications. You can use the compare feature of database project to get all changes from development server and import all those scripts directly into your project. You now just have to \"commit\" your change into your source code controller.\n\nWith this method, you can have a versioned database. You can spot the version of each modification and roll back your changes.\n\nThis is not the only advantage. With this kind of project, you can compare any databases to your project to script the changes and with SQL PowerShell command prompt, you can update all of your databases with the same script: this script is an XML schema of your database. It will execute only the needed commands to update your databases. You also have the possibility to make [unit test](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa833148.aspx) in your database. An other good article for database project is available [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xee70aty.aspx). With the deploy feature, you can have pre-script and post-script. With those scripts you can had validation nor insert data into your system tables.\n\n[Here](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=548) is a good step by step procedure for database project.",

        "answer": "The *major* reasons not to `#include` .c files in other .c files are:\n\n* Avoid duplicate definition errors: suppose `foo.c` defines the function `foo()`. You have two other files that use `foo()`, so you `#include \"foo.c\"` in both of them. When you try to build your project, the compiler will translate `foo.c` multiple times, meaning it will see multiple attempts to define the `foo` function, which will cause it to issue a diagnostic and halt.\n* Minimize build times: even if you don't introduce duplicate definition errors, you wind up recompiling the same code needlessly. Suppose you `#include \"foo.c\"` in `bar.c`, and you discover you need to make a one-line change in `bar.c`. When you rebuild, you wind up re-translating the contents of `foo.c` *unnecessarily*.\n\nC allows you to compile your source files separately of each other, and then link the resulting object files together to build your applications or libraries.

        "answer": "> \n> 1. What exactly does context manager do with connections and sessions?\n>  Closing session and disposing connection or what?\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe context manager in Python is used to create a runtime context for use with the `with` statement. Simply, when you run the code:\n\n```\nwith session_scope() as session:\n    entity = session.query(SomeEntity).first()\n\n```\n\nsession is the yielded session. So, to your question of what the context manager does with the connections and sessions, all you have to do is look at what happens after the `yield` to see what happens. In this case it's just:\n\n```\ntry:\n    yield session\n    session.commit()\nexcept:\n    session.rollback()\n    raise\n\n```\n\nIf you trigger no exceptions, it will be `session.commit()`, which according to the SQLAlchemy docs will \"Flush pending changes and commit the current transaction.\"\n\n> \n> 2. Why does first working example of code behave as example with issue\n>  without NullPool as poolclass in \"connect\" method?\n> \n> \n> \n\nThe [`poolclass`](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine.params.poolclass) argument is just telling SQLAlchemy which subclass of `Pool` to use. However, in the case where you pass `NullPool` here, you are telling SQLAlchemy to not use a pool. You're effectively disabling pooling connections when you pass in `NullPool`. From the docs: \"to disable pooling, set poolclass to NullPool instead.\" I can't say for sure but using `NullPool` is probably contributing to your `max_connection` issues.\n\n> \n> 3.

I think this has to do with how in the first example, you are using a context manager so everything within the `with` block will use a `session` generator. In your second example, you created a function that initializes a new `Session` and returns it, so you're not getting back a generator. I also think this has to do with your `NullPool` use which prevents connection pooling. With `NullPool` each query execution is acquiring a connection on its own.\n\n> \n> 4.

(I mean raw\n>  SQLAlchemy not Flask-SQLAlchemy or smth like this)\n> \n> \n> \n\nSee the section [Is the session thread-safe?](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_basics.html#is-the-session-thread-safe) for this, but you need to take a \"share nothing\" approach to your concurrency. So in your case, you need each instance of a script to share nothing between each other.\n\nYou probably want to check out [Working with Engines and Connections](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/connections.html). I don't think messing with sessions is where you want to be if concurrency is what you're working on. There's more information about the `NullPool` and concurrency there:\n\n> \n> For a multiple-process application that uses the os.fork system call,\n>  or for example the Python multiprocessing module, it\u2019s usually\n>  required that a separate Engine be used for each child process. This\n>  is because the Engine maintains a reference to a connection pool that\n>  ultimately references DBAPI connections - these tend to not be\n>  portable across process boundaries. An Engine that is configured not\n>  to use pooling (which is achieved via the usage of NullPool) does not\n>  have this requirement.\n> \n> \n>",

        "question": "I've inherited some code, littered with GridView's, and I've noticed the following sorts of references in the `OnItemDataBound` method:\n\n```\nLabel lblSomething = (Label)e.Row.Cells[3].FindControl(\"lblSomething\");\nLabel lblSomethingElse = (Label)e.Row.Cells[3].FindControl(\"lblSomethingElse\");\n\n```\n\nThe \"issue\" is that `lblSomething` and `lblSomethingElse` aren't actually in the same cell, but they both appear to be working correctly anyway. Simplifying a bit:\n\n```\n<Columns>\n    <asp:TemplateField runat=\"server\" HeaderText=\"Online materials available to assign\">\n        <ItemTemplate>\n            <asp:Label ID=\"lblThis\" runat=\"server\"></asp:Label>\n        </ItemTemplate>\n    </asp:TemplateField>\n\n    <asp:TemplateField HeaderText=\"Assign\" HeaderStyle-Width=\"75px\">\n        <ItemTemplate>\n            <asp:Label ID=\"lblThat\" runat=\"server\"></asp:Label>\n        </ItemTemplate>\n    </asp:TemplateField>\n\n    <asp:TemplateField HeaderText=\"Assign\" HeaderStyle-Width=\"75px\">\n        <ItemTemplate>\n            <asp:Label ID=\"lblSomething\" runat=\"server\"></asp:Label>\n        </ItemTemplate>\n    </asp:TemplateField>\n\n    <asp:TemplateField HeaderText=\"Assign\" HeaderStyle-Width=\"75px\">\n        <ItemTemplate>\n            <asp:Label ID=\"lblSomethingElse\" runat=\"server\"></asp:Label>\n        </ItemTemplate>\n    </asp:TemplateField>                        \n\n</Columns>\n\n```\n\nIs this behavior expected?

        "question": "I need a function that (like SecureZeroMemory from the WinAPI) always zeros memory and doesn't get optimized away, even if the compiler thinks the memory is never going to accessed again after that. Seems like a perfect candidate for volatile. But I'm having some problems actually getting this to work with GCC. Here is an example function:\n\n```\nvoid volatileZeroMemory(volatile void* ptr, unsigned long long size)\n{\n    volatile unsigned char* bytePtr = (volatile unsigned char*)ptr;\n\n    while (size--)\n    {\n        *bytePtr++ = 0;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nSimple enough. But the code that GCC actually generates if you call it varies wildly with the compiler version and the amount of bytes you're actually trying to zero. <https://godbolt.org/g/cMaQm2>\n\n* GCC 4.4.7 and 4.5.3 never ignore the volatile.\n* GCC 4.6.4 and 4.7.3 ignore volatile for array sizes 1, 2, and 4.\n* GCC 4.8.1 until 4.9.2 ignore volatile for array sizes 1 and 2.\n* GCC 5.1 until 5.3 ignore volatile for array sizes 1, 2, 4, 8.\n* GCC 6.1 just ignores it for any array size (bonus points for consistency).\n\nAny other compiler I have tested (clang, icc, vc) generates the stores one would expect, with any compiler version and any array size. So at this point I'm wondering, is this a (pretty old and severe?) GCC compiler bug, or is the definition of volatile in the standard that imprecise that this is actually conforming behavior, making it essentially impossible to write a portable \"SecureZeroMemory\" function?\n\nEdit: Some interesting observations.\n\n```\n#include <cstddef>\n#include <cstdint>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <atomic>\n\nvoid callMeMaybe(char* buf);\n\nvoid volatileZeroMemory(volatile void* ptr, std::size_t size)\n{\n    for (auto bytePtr = static_cast<volatile std::uint8_t*>(ptr); size-- > 0; )\n    {\n        *bytePtr++ = 0;\n    }\n\n    //std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);\n}\n\nstd::size_t foo()\n{\n    char arr[8];\n    callMeMaybe(arr);\n    volatileZeroMemory(arr, sizeof arr);\n    return sizeof arr;\n}\n\n```\n\n[The possible write from callMeMaybe() will make all GCC versions except 6.1 generate the expected stores.](https://godbolt.org/g/v8lMjG) Commenting in the memory fence will also make GCC 6.1 generate the stores, although only in combination with the possible write from callMeMaybe().\n\nSomeone has also suggested to flush the caches. [Microsoft does **not** try to flush the cache at all in \"SecureZeroMemory\".](http://codepad.org/1yC7a8J8) The cache is likely going to be invalidated pretty fast anyway, so this is probably not be a big deal. Also, if another program was trying to probe the data, or if it was going to be written to the page file, it would always be the zeroed version.\n\nThere are also some concerns about GCC 6.1 using memset() in the standalone function. The GCC 6.1 compiler on godbolt might a broken build, as GCC 6.1 seems to generate a normal loop (like 5.3 does on godbolt) for the standalone function for some people. (Read comments of zwol's answer.)",
        "answer": "GCC's behavior *may* be conforming, and even if it isn't, you should not rely on `volatile` to do what you want in cases like these. The C committee designed `volatile` for memory-mapped hardware registers and for variables modified during abnormal control flow (e.g. signal handlers and `setjmp`). **Those are the only things it is reliable for.** It is not safe to use as a general \"don't optimize this out\" annotation.\n\nIn particular, the standard is unclear on a key point. (I've converted your code to C; there *shouldn't* be any divergence between C and C++ here. I've also manually done the inlining that would happen before the questionable optimization, to show what the compiler \"sees\" at that point.)\n\n```\nextern void use_arr(void *, size_t);\nvoid foo(void)\n{\n    char arr[8];\n    use_arr(arr, sizeof arr);\n\n    for (volatile char *p = (volatile char *)arr;\n         p < (volatile char *)(arr + 8);\n         p++)\n      *p = 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nThe memory-clearing loop accesses `arr` through a volatile-qualified lvalue, but `arr` itself is *not* declared `volatile`. It is, therefore, at least arguably allowed for the C compiler to infer that the stores made by the loop are \"dead\", and delete the loop altogether. There's text in the C Rationale that implies that the committee **meant** to require those stores to be preserved, but the standard itself does not actually make that requirement, as I read it.\n\nFor more discussion of what the standard does or does not require, see [Why is a volatile local variable optimised differently from a volatile argument, and why does the optimiser generate a no-op loop from the latter?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38235112/why-is-a-volatile-local-variable-optimised-differently-from-a-volatile-argument), [Does accessing a declared non-volatile object through a volatile reference/pointer confer volatile rules upon said accesses?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38243501/does-accessing-a-declared-non-volatile-object-through-a-volatile-reference-point), and [GCC bug 71793](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=71793).\n\nFor more on what the committee *thought* `volatile` was for, search the [C99 Rationale](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf) for the word \"volatile\". John Regehr's paper \"[Volatiles are Miscompiled](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/emsoft08-preprint.pdf)\" illustrates in detail how programmer expectations for `volatile` may not be satisfied by production compilers. The LLVM team's series of essays \"[What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior](http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html)\" does not touch specifically on `volatile` but will help you understand how and why modern C compilers are *not* \"portable assemblers\".\n\n---\n\nTo the **practical** question of how to implement a function that does what you wanted `volatileZeroMemory` to do: Regardless of what the standard requires or was meant to require, it would be wisest to assume that you can't use `volatile` for this. There *is* an alternative that can be relied on to work, because it would break far too much other stuff if it didn't work:\n\n```\nextern void memory_optimization_fence(void *ptr, size_t size);\ninline void\nexplicit_bzero(void *ptr, size_t size)\n{\n   memset(ptr, 0, size);\n   memory_optimization_fence(ptr, size);\n}\n\n/* in a separate source file */\nvoid memory_optimization_fence(void *unused1, size_t unused2) {}\n\n```\n\nHowever, you must make absolutely sure that `memory_optimization_fence` is not inlined under any circumstances. It must be in its own source file and it must not be subjected to link-time optimization.\n\nThere are other options, relying on compiler extensions, that may be usable under some circumstances and can generate tighter code (one of them appeared in a previous edition of this answer), but none are universal.\n\n(I recommend calling the function `explicit_bzero`, because it is available under that name in more than one C library. There are at least four other contenders for the name, but each has been adopted only by a single C library.)\n\nYou should also know that, even if you can get this to work, it may not be enough. In particular, consider\n\n```\nstruct aes_expanded_key { __uint128_t rndk[16]; };\n\nvoid encrypt(const char *key, const char *iv,\n             const char *in, char *out, size_t size)\n{\n    aes_expanded_key ek;\n    expand_key(key, ek);\n    encrypt_with_ek(ek, iv, in, out, size);\n    explicit_bzero(&ek, sizeof ek);\n}\n\n```\n\nAssuming hardware with AES acceleration instructions, if `expand_key` and `encrypt_with_ek` are inline, the compiler may be able to keep `ek` entirely in the vector register file -- until the call to `explicit_bzero`, which forces it to *copy the sensitive data onto the stack* just to erase it, and, worse, doesn't do a darn thing about the keys that are still sitting in the vector registers!",

        "question": "I am currently working as the DM for Out of the Abyss and have a Paladin in my party. This means at level 5, I need to come up with a Mount for her.\n\nDue to the Underdark being the Underdark, traditional surface world mounts aren't terribly useful. A Horse is going to have a hard time navigating the tunnels and cliffs and ledges and everything else that makes up the terrain. I don't want to give one of my players a basically useless class feature.\n\nAccording to everything I have run across for 5E, there are only two types of creature used in the Underdark as Mounts... Giant Lizards and Steeders. \n\nI would like to give her more options than that.\n\nSo, are there any other creatures traditionally used as viable mounts in the Underdark? I will gladly accept results from other editions of D&D...I don't mind re-statting things. The player is controlling a medium-sized character.\n\nAs my choice of tags and wording did not make this clear, allow me to clarify what I am looking for.\n\nI am looking for a Mount for a Paladin using Find Steed at Fifth Level. It must meet the following requirements:\n\n* Large Size\n* CR no greater than 1 (CR of a Steeder)\n* Is used *in lore* by Underdark races as a mount.\n* Must meet the 'physical anatomy' requirements necessary to be ridden\n* Must not have a Flying Speed\n* Must come from official D&D material, or WotC sanctioned fiction\n\nI am looking for another mount that is in the same 'class' of creatures as the ones that are already listed as options for the Find Steed Spell (warhorse, pony, camel, elk, or mastiff), but is *canonically* used as a mount in the Underdark, by one of the races that lives there. I am looking for an answer from official Dungeons and Dragons material, not homebrew, and would greatly appreciate a reference to the rulebook or D&D publication that contains this information. I will also accept WotC sanctioned fiction that features adventures in the Underdark and having a creature as a mount.\n\nIf no in-lore, canonical alternative exists, then 'there is nothing else' is a valid answer (assuming it is properly backed).\n\nTo be clear: I am looking *exclusively* for mounts used by the races of the Underdark, *not* mounts from the surface that could be useful on rough terrain or in caverns. I am capable of doing the research for other suitable non-Underdark mounts on my own and am looking to supplement this with lore-friendly Underdark options.",

(*Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned as steeds*.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, *its Intelligence becomes 6*, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak. \n> \n> \n> \n\nBecause the summoned steed is *a spirit in the form of a giant goat*, I see no obstacle to using one. \n\nNow that the question has changed to only include lore-based Underdark mounts, this answer only fits if someone in the Underdark ever had a goat.

I get the point that locks are not needed to modify the data but you end up with multiple versions of it after concurrent modifications. That doesn't seem very useful in practice. I've tried to describe this with a simple scenario below:\n\nLet's say we have 2 threads A and B. They are both modifying a purely functional dictionary D. They don't need locks at this point because the data is immutable so they output new dictionaries DA and DB. Now my question is how do you reconcile DA and DB so that later operations can see a single view of the data?\n\nEDIT: The answers are suggesting to use a `merge` function over DA and DB. I don't see how that solves the problem since there could be another thread C which runs concurrently with the merge operation. The claim is that purely functional data structures are lock-free but using a merge function sounds more like eventual consistency which is a different thing.",

In your scenario, DA and DB are guaranteed to be consistent, how to merge them into a consistent value depends on your application (functional programming will not solve ALL your problems for you).

        "answer": "The data being sent to your controller is null because no data is being sent in your AJAX call.\n\nThis line:\n\n```\ndata: {},\n\n```\n\nShould contain the data you wish to return.\n\nIn your case you can restructure your call as follows:\n\n```\nfunction GenerateHTMLTOPDF() {        \n        $.ajax({\n        var d = $('#tinymce').html( tinymce.get('tinymce').getContent() );\n\n        dataType: 'json',\n        type: \"POST\",\n        url: '@Url.Action(\"GeneratePDFFOrProductHandler\", \"Product\")',\n        data: {d},\n        success: function (data) {\n             window.location.href = data;\n        },\n        error: function (request, status, error) {\n             //Error handling\n        }\n    });  \n\n}\n\n```\n\nAlso you cannot redirect via an AJAX post, this line:\n\n```\nreturn RedirectToAction(model.DesignId, \"Prdocut/Edit\");\n\n```\n\nwill not function as intended.\n\n```\nreturn Json(Url.Action(\"Prdocut\", \"Edit\"));\n\n```\n\nThe above will return JSON data with the window location that you can navigate to using javascript. This will **not** pass the pdf model that was created in GeneratePDF. You will have to restructure your code to do that as the current structure makes it difficult to achieve the functionality you are looking for.\n\nAJAX is not meant to pass complex Objects back and forth similar to how controllers can, it passes data in the form of datatypes such as JSON/HTML/XML, full docs can be found [here](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) (navigate to datatypes). If necessary you can serialize an object, send it, change it in the backend, retrieve it as a JSON structure of a complex object and reassemble the object, however it's simpler and better practice to reevaluate what you are trying to do and creating a proper MVC architecture.",

        "question": "What happens to your damage when you are giving your opponents negative magic resist / armour?\n\nFor example I am playing Fiddlesticks and I have:\n\n1. Passive (-10mres)\n2. Abyssal Scepter (-20 mres)\n3. Haunting Guise (20 mpen)\n4. Sorcerer's Shoes (20 mpen)\n\n...and I am casting skill that does 100 damage on an Ashe with 30 base mres and no mres items?",
        "answer": "I think you're really asking two separate questions here. The first is, \"What order do the various MR reduction / penetration effects follow?\"\n\nThe answer to that is relatively simple.\n\n> \n> Armor/MR Reduction\n> \n> \n> % Based Armor/MR **Reduction**\n> \n> \n> % Based Armor/MR **Penetration**\n> \n> \n> Flat/Linear Armor/MR Penetration\n> \n> \n> \n\nSo to answer the question as per the above, first Fiddlesticks' passive is applied to Ashe, reducing her Magic Resistance to 20. Next, the Abyssal Scepter effects is calculated, reducing Ashe's MR by 20, putting her at 0. Finally, the flat penetration from the Sorcerer's Shoes and the Haunting Guise are considered -- but Ashe is already at 0 MR, so there is no further MR to \"penetrate\".\n\n**Penetration can never bring a champion's defenses below zero.**\n\nSo in the above scenario, spells would do 100% damage, so the full 100 damage in your example case.\n\nTo answer your second question, about the general case of negative magic resistances (possible on jungle creeps, and in some games featuring Karthas / Soraka / Kayle, etc), I bid you to look no further than [this question](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/10244/how-can-the-damage-reduction-from-armor-in-league-of-legends-not-have-diminishing/10245#10245).\n\nThe effects of negative defenses are exactly the same as the effects of positive defenses\\* - linear. In a nutshell, this means that an Abyssal Scepter will increase your spell DPS by the same amount regardless of whether the champion is starting with 100 MR or -100.\n\n\\*the formula itself is different, because the armor calculation doesn't handle negative values well, but the end result is a continuation of Armor's linear scaling.",

        "question": "Rust is known as a memory-safe language, but there is a security feature in GCC called [AddressSanitizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer) (ASAN): \n\n```none\n./configure CFLAGS=\"-fsanitize=address -g\" CXXFLAGS=\"-fsanitize=address -g\" LDFLAGS=\"-fsanitize=address\"\nmake\nmake check\n\n```\n\nCould ASAN provide the same memory safety as Rust, or does Rust have more tricks? Is it even possible to compare the two? \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a programmer.",
        "answer": "**The sanitizers**\n\nBoth GCC and Clang have a *suite* of sanitizers; up until now, they were developed in Clang and then ported to GCC, so Clang has the most advanced versions:\n\n* [Address Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) (ASan): detects out-of-bounds access, use-after-free, use-after-scope, double-free/invalid-free and is adding support for memory leaks (expected memory overhead 3x),\n* [Memory Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html) (MemSan): detects uninitialized reads (expected slow-down 3x),\n* [Thread Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html) (TSan): detects data-races (expected slow-down 5x-15x, memory overhead 5x-10x),\n* [Undefined Behavior Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html) (UBSan): various local undefined behaviors such as unaligned pointers, integral/floating point overflows, etc... (minimal slow-down, slight code size increase).\n\nThere is also work ongoing on a [Type Sanitizer](https://reviews.llvm.org/D32199).\n\n---\n\n**Sanitizers vs Rust**\n\nUnfortunately, bringing C++ up to Rust's level of safety with sanitizers is not possible; even combining all existing sanitizers would still leave gaps, they are known to be incomplete.\n\nYou can see John Regher's presentation on Undefined Behavior at [CppCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1COuU2vU_w), the slides [can be found on github](https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2017/blob/master/Presentations/Undefined%20Behavior%20in%202017/Undefined%20Behavior%20in%202017%20-%20John%20Regehr%20-%20CppCon%202017.pdf), from which we get the current coverage:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/l5O7e.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/l5O7e.png)\n\nAnd that is not accounting for the fact that **sanitizers are incompatible with each others**. That is, even if you were willing to accept the combined slow-down (15x-45x?) and memory overhead (15x-30x?), you would still NOT manage for a C++ program to be as safe as a Rust one.\n\n---\n\n**Hardening vs Debugging**\n\nThe reason sanitizers are so CPU/memory hungry is because they are debugging tools; they attempt to give developers as precise a diagnostic as possible, so as to be most useful for debugging.\n\nFor running code in production, what you are looking for is **hardening**. Hardening is about eliminating Undefined Behavior with as low an overhead as possible. Clang, for example, supports multiple ways to harden a binary:\n\n* [Control Flow Integrity](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html) (CFI): protects against control-flow hi-jacking (virtual calls, indirect calls, ...),\n* [Safe Stack](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SafeStack.html): protects against stack buffer overflows, aka [Return Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming),\n* Undefined Behavior Sanitizer.\n\nThose tools can be combined and have minimal (< 1%) performance impact. They cover much less ground than sanitizers, unfortunately, and most notably do not attempt to cover use-after-free/use-after-scope or data-races which are frequent targets of attacks.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI do not see any way to bring C++ up to the level of safety that Rust combines, without either:\n\n* very serious restrictions on the language: see MISRA/JSF guidelines,\n* very serious loss of performance: sanitizers, disabling optimizations, ...\n* a complete overhaul of the standard library and coding practices, of which the [Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) are a **start**.\n\nOn the other hand, it is worth noting that Rust itself uses `unsafe` code; and its `unsafe` code also needs to be vetted (see [Rust Belt project](https://plv.mpi-sws.org/rustbelt/)) and would benefit from all the above sanitizers/hardening instrumentation passes.",

        "question": "Are the different interpretations of Quantum mechanics just different viewpoints of the same physical reality? Or can experiments distinguish them? Are they empirically distinguishable or not?\n\nI have read a paper in which Asher Peres states that quantum mechanics needs no interpretation and we can understand it by a minimum number of necessary postulates. Here is the last paragraph of the paper:\n\n> \n> All this said, we would be the last to claim that the foundations of\n>  quantum theory are not worth further scrutiny. For instance, it is\n>  interesting to search for minimal sets of physical assumptions that\n>  give rise to the theory. Also, it is not yet understood how to combine\n>  quantum mechanics with gravitation, and there may well be important\n>  insight to be gleaned there. However, to make quantum mechanics a\n>  useful guide to the phenomena around us, we need nothing more than the\n>  fully consistent theory we already have. Quantum theory needs no\n>  interpretation.\n> \n> \n> \n\nThis is the link to the paper (it is a paper with only two pages) [Peres](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/53/3/10.1063/1.883004)\n\nCan you explain what he means when he says \"quantum mechanics needs no interpretation\"? i didn't get it from the paper!. Does he mean that we shouldn't try to assign any objective meaning to the wave function and consider it as reflection of our knowledge about the system? If yes, isn't it what Copenhagen interpretation says?!! (This is from wiki page of Copenhagen interpretation:\"The wave function reflects our knowledge of the system\") \n\nAnd finally, has anyone found that minimum number of postulates?",
        "answer": "On paper, the difference between a theory and an interpretation is very clear. If two distinct sets of ideas/explanations generate experimentally distinguishable predictions, then they are two different theories. If they use different concepts but produce identical experimentally verifiable predictions, then they are two different interpretations of the same physical theory.\n\nIn practice, things are never so clear-cut. As a practical matter, we certainly do not currently possess either the theoretical or the experimental capability to unambiguously falsify either the many-worlds or Copenhagen interpretation in any experiment that can actually be performed in the real world. But as Count Iblis points out, there probably *are* some hypothetical experiments that distinguish them, which could be performed in principle but may never actually be feasible in practice. (I think the same is true of the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, although I'm not familiar enough with that interpretation to say for sure.) For example, decoherence is defined to be the vanishing of all the elements of a system's reduced density matrix that are off-diagonal in some basis known as the \"pointer basis\". But perfect decoherence is an idealization; in practice the off-diagnonal elements will be exponentially small but never exactly zero. (Similarly, there will always be incredibly many-point tunneling terms connect different branches of the wavefunction that appear at zillionth order in perturbation theory.)\n\nSo as *practical* matter, the many-worlds and Copenhagen interpretations are equivalent as physical theories to within our current understanding. In principle, they are almost certainly distinguishable if one could perform arbitrarily precise experiments and had infinite processing power. I would argue that we do not yet understand the different interpretations well enough to judge whether they will ever be experimentally distingishable in practice with foreseeable technology.\n\nSo you could approach this situation in many ways, and take any of the following (defensible) perspectives:\n\n1. MWI's and Copenhagen's predictions are indistinguishable in practice, so they are different interpretations of the same theory.\n2. MWI's and Copenhagen's predictions are distinguishable in principle, so they are different theories but are equivalent in practice.\n3. We don't understand MWI and Copenhagen well enough to judge whether they will be experimentally distinguishable in the future. So we do not yet know whether they are different theories or simply different interpretations.\n4. We don't understand MWI and Copenhagen well enough to judge whether they will ever be experimentally distinguishable in the future. But we should reserve the term \"theory\" to mean \"something that we actually know how to distinguish in practice\", and use \"interpretations\" to mean \"ideas that we do not *currently* know how to distinguish experimentally\". So the distinction between a theory and an interpretation is dependent on the scientific community's current knowledge of the subject. MWI and Copenhagen are currently just two different interpretations of the same theory, but way well eventually become two different theories as our understanding and/or experimental technology advance.\n\nThis distinction between actual experiments and \"theoretical experiments\" (a term with an interestingly semi-contradictory nature) comes up in other areas of physics as well. For example, Scott Aaronson's essay \"[Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity](https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/philos.pdf)\" puts a slightly different spin on some related ideas, and argues persuasively that philosophers should take seriously the practical limitations on what experiments and calculations could actually be performed in the real world.",

        "question": "For a balanced binary training dataset i.e number of data points with class +1 are equal to number of data points with class -1 , what will happen if we use weak binary classifiers whose classification accuracy is less\nthan 50%, say 30%? Will the performance of the combined classifier improve with more iterations?\n\nI am aware that binary classifiers who perform worse than 50%, still contribute to final prediction, but will the performance of combined classifiers improve with more iterations ?",
        "answer": "Semantic segmentation of an image (at least in context of CNN based methods) can simply be viewed as a pixel-wise classification problem, that is to say that you assign a class to every pixel of the image. So in your case if you are able to successfully perform a semantic segmentation of your camera feed then the problem of classification of cars/no cars is trivial or rather non-existent since you were able to solve a more difficult problem of classifying every pixel. Just check for cars in your pixel-wise classification output.\n\nHowever, if your objective is only to identify whether or not there is a car in frame then honestly semantic segmentation is a overkill and I don't see any reason why you can't train a near perfect binary classifier for cars/no cars problem which would be robust to various background artifacts(buildings etc.) even with limited data. Try transfer learning on ILSVRC pre-trained resnet 34 or smaller variants. Fine tune the final few layers first and then when you hit saturation fine tune the entire network with these updated weights. You can also try cyclical learning rates (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186>).",

        "question": "So I would like to do a select from an SQL database, using Java, subject to a conditional statement (less than or equal to something) subject to some loop in Java. In other words, something like the following:\n\n```\nfor (int i=0; i< 195; i++) {\n            // Get the results of the SQL query\n            resultSet = statement.executeQuery( \n                    \"SELECT max( millisFromMid ) FROM stockInfo1 WHERE ( millisFromMid <=  34200000 + (120000)*i ) GROUP BY stockID\" \n                    );\n\n```\n\nNow Java is returning an exception here, because it doesn't want me to use \"i\" in this condition; however, without being able to use it here, I'm not sure how I can change this condition. The problem is this: I'm looking to retrieve data from one database, with the intent of doing some manipulation and putting the results into a new database. These manipulations depend on taking the most recent data available, which is why I'm wanting to increase the number bounding millisFromMid. Does that make sense?\n\nDoes anyone have a suggestion on how someone might do something like this? This seems like a fundamental skill to have when using Java and SQL together, so I'd very much like to know it.",

Instead make Java put the value into the string and then submit it to the database.\n\nstring sql = \"select \\* from foo where bar=\" + i;\n\nYou need to remember at all times that the database only knows what you explicitly tell it, and that you are essentially writing code at runtime that will execute on another host.",

Iuj e\u0109 praktikas tion uzante precipe la vortojn *aliel* kaj *alies*.\n> \n> \n> \n\nI would say the problem is well-treated in that PMEG article, but I'd appreciate an English-language summary of why this is considered incorrect. \n\nIt seems to be such a natural mistake, so natural that many people come to it spontaneously without having seen it before, and others try to defend it and use it purposely. For this reason I think it's an important issue to highlight and explain, because it seems like a possible hotspot of natural evolution and unintended development of irregularity in the casual use of the Esperanto language. Since Esperanto is a living language, I feel it's not in anyone's power anymore to stamp out natural growth. But because Esperanto is often touted as a completely regular language this seems to be a bit of a glaring contradiction to that claim. Of course \"ali-\" tabelvortoj are not official, but they seem to appear commonly in day to day writing and speech, intentionally or not.\n\nSo, why are these *ali-* tabelvortoj considered to be incorrect? And, if it doesn't convolute this question too much, has anyone else seen examples of irregularities like this in Esperanto, whether embedded within the 'official' Esperanto language or sliding by undetected in the flawed, natural, everyday speech of its speakers?",
        "answer": "The reason why it is considered incorrect is simply because, as PMEG states, *ali* already is a defined root. Thus *alio*, *alia*, *alie* etc. are already words, whose definition need not coincide with the proposed definitions of the correlative-equivalent. (In particular, *alie* would then mean \u2018elsewhere\u2019, *alia* would only be \u2018another kind\u2019 and not \u2018other\u2019 in a more general sense.)\n\nThe reason why PMEG (and also PIV) recommends not using the other correlative-suffixes to the root *ali* is because it would cause confusion. If someone uses *alies* and *aliel*, one may extrapolate that *alie* means \u2018elsewhere\u2019, which it does not. This would cause confusion.\n\nThe remainder of the PMEG article further points out some illogicalities of using *ali-* as a correlative root. For instance, that you could no longer say *alikaze*, because with correlatives, you cannot remove the suffix: We say *tiukaze*, not *tikaze*, etc.",

The hosts feeds the tick and the tick has some sort of beneficial substance within its saliva. This could be some sort of naturally evolved anti-fungal or anti-biotic. This relationship would allow those with the tick to out compete those without the tick due to superior disease resistance.",
        "answer": "This is literally the definition of [symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis). The only issue in your question, as pointed out in comments, is that a parasite is definitionally not a symbiote, as a parasite derives a benefit for itself while damaging its host. Symbiotic relationships involve benefits to both organisms.\n\nThere are tons of examples of this in the world right now. Think of [remora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remora) cleaning sharks in order to feed themselves and avoid predators, or (again already mentioned in comments) mitochondria in animal cells.\n\nFrom a worldbuilding perspective, the key elements are that both organisms derive a net benefit from the relationship, and exist in such a way that they can interact to produce those benefits (like living physically close enough to interact, as in the remora, or even becoming incorporated into the same larger organism, as in the mitochondria). The net benefit piece means that there can still be negative consequences to the interactions, just that the balance must tip towards the favorable.",

The fact is that there is a lot of algorithms with different **time complexity** and **specificity**. Take the most famous one, the $K$-Means, it is in $O(n)$ so pretty fast but you have to specify how many cluster you want which is not what you intend by exploring an unknown image without any information about how many shapes are presents in it. Moreover even if you suppose that you know how many shape are present, we may suppose that there shapes are random which is another point where the $K$-Means fail because it is design to find elliptic clusters and **NOT** random shape ones.\n\nAt the opposite we have the Mean Shift that is able to find **automatically** the number of cluster -- which is useful when you don't know what you're looking for -- with **random shapes**.\n\nOf course you replace the $K$ parameter of $K$-Means by others Mean Shift parameters which can be tricky to fine tuned but it doesn't exist a tool that allow you to do magic if you're not exercising to do magic.\n\nAn advice to image segmentation clustering\n==========================================\n\nTransform your color space from RGB to LUV which is better for euclidean distance.\n\n$K$-Means vs Mean Shift LSH time complexity\n===========================================\n\n* Mean Shift : $O(\\alpha.n)$\n* K-Means : $O(\\beta.n)$\n* $\\alpha \\gt \\beta$\n\nMean Shift LSH is slower but it fits better with your needs.

        "answer": "**Examination of `del/3`**\n\n```\n(1) del(S,[P],[P]).\n(2) del(S,[S],[]).\n(3) del(S,[H1,H2|T],L2) :- H1 = S, del([H2|T],L2).\n(4) del(S,[H1,H2|T],[H1,T2]) :- H1 \\= S, del([H2|T],T2).\n\n```\n\n(1) This rule says that *the list `[P]` is the list `[P]` with the element `S` removed*. The problem with this rule is that `S` and `P` could be the same value, and so the rule isn't always true. If you wanted this to be true all the time (be a valid rule), you'd need to stipulate that `S` and `P` can't be instantiated to the same value:\n\n```\ndel(S, [P], [P]) :- S \\= P.\n\n```\n\nThat's assuming we even need this rule, but we'll leave it here for the time being as, in this new state, it's correct.\n\n(2) This rule says that *`[]` is the list `[S]` with the element `S` removed*. That is true.\n\n(3) This rule says that *`L2` is the list `[H1,H2|T]` with `S` removed if `H1` and `S` are unified and `L2` is `[H2|T]` with `S` removed.* BUT, there's a missing argument. You have `del([H2|T], L2)` but the `del/3` is defined to take 3 arguments. We'll assume you meant `S` is the first argument (`S` is still what's being removed), so `del(S, [H2|T], L2)`. The newly repaired rule appears to be logical.\n\n(4) This rule says that \\*`[H1,T2]` is the list `[H1,H2|T]` with the element `S` removed if `H1` is not unifiable with `S` and `T2` is the list `[H2|T]` with the element `S` removed. This has the same problem as #3 with the missing argument to `del/3` which we'll, again, assume is `S`, making it, `del(S, [H2|T], T2)`. Another problem is that you have `[H1,T2]` which is a list of only two elements: `H1` and `T2`. Another typo. This should be `[H1|T2]`. So the repaired rule seems to make sense now.\n\nJust fixing these couple of careless errors causes your predicate to almost work! It will yield the correct result when the first argument is instantiated:\n\n```\n| ?- del(a, [a,b,c,a,d,a], L).\n\nL = [b,c,d] ? a\n\nno\n\n```\n\nAlso, it can be cleaned up a bit. The `H2` isn't really used in the 3rd and 4th clauses. And in the 3rd clause you can instantiate `S` and `H1` in the head of the predicate. So those two become:\n\n```\n(3) del(S, [S|T], L2) :- del(S, T, L2).\n(4) del(S, [H|T], [H|T2]) :- H \\= S, del(S, T, T2).\n\n```\n\nThe predicate fails on the list being empty. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but you could argue that `del(X, [], [])` should be true (an empty list results when you remove an element from the empty list). If we include this rule:\n\n```\n(1a) del(_, [], []).\n\n```\n\nWe can now get rid of rules (1) and (2) because (3) and (4) will take care of them and recurse down to rule (1a).\n\nAdditionally, the rules still fail on this case:\n\n```\n| ?- del(X, [a,b,c], [a,c]).\n\nno\n\n```\n\nIt would be nice if this burped out, `X = b`. The problem is in clause (4) where we check `H \\= S` which means *`H` and `S` are not unifiable*. This expression works against us if `S` is a variable because then `H \\= S` will always fail (since `S` could indeed be unified to `H`). So we replace it with `dif(H,S)` to check if these terms are the same. \nSome Prologs don't offer `dif/2`, in which case, you could substitute `\\==` for this solution (`H \\== S`). Our resulting rule set is:\n\n```\n(1) del(_, [], []).\n(2) del(S, [S|T], L2) :- del(S, T, L2).\n(3) del(S, [H|T], [H|T2]) :- dif(H, S), del(S, T, T2).\n\n```\n\nLet's \"reread\" these rules:\n\n1. Any element removed from the empty list is the empty list.\n2. The list `[S|T]` with the element `S` removed is the list `L2` *if* `L2` is the list `T` with the element `S` removed.\n3. The list `[H|T2]` is the list `[H|T]` with the element `S` removed *if* `S` is different than `H` and `T2` is the list `T` with the element `S` removed.\n\nThat looks a lot simpler although just a couple of simple reworks away from the original. It will now produce this result, which is nice:\n\n```\n| ?- del1(X, [a,b,c,b,d], [a,c,d]).\n\nX = b ? ;\n\n(1 ms) no\n\n```\n\n**Examination of `change/2`**\n\n```\n(1) change([],[]).\n(2) change([H1,H2|T],L) :- H1 = 2, append([2],L), change([H2|T],L).\n(3) change([H1,H2|T],L) :- H1 \\= 2, append(H1,L), change([H2|T],L).\n\n```\n\n(1) This rule says if we change all the 2's in the empty list, we get the empty list. Sounds good.\n\n(2) This rule says if I take the list `[H1,H2|T]` and I change the 2's to 4's, I get `L` if `H1` is 2 and I append `L` to `[2]` (which will always fail since `[2]` is not variable - see the online docs for `append/2` and `append/3`! `append/2` is for appending lists of lists, for example) and `L` is `[H2|T]` with 2's changed to 4's. Already this isn't making any logical sense at all. If I'm changing 2's to 4's why am I appending something to `[2]`? We need to lose the `append` and simply unify `L` with `[4|T2]` where `T2` is `[H2|T]` with its 2's changed to 4's. Or in other words:\n\n```\n(2) change([H1,H2|T], L) :- H1 = 2, L = [4|T2], change([H2|T], T2).\n\n```\n\nThis can be simplified further using the method of incorporating the unification in the head of the clause as above. Also note, again, we have no real use for making `H2` visible here. So `[H2|T]` can just be a `T`:\n\n```\n(2) change([2|T], [4|T2]) :- change(T, T2).\n\n```\n\nSo we use a 4 instead of a 2 if there's a 2, then process the tails.\n\n(3) This rule has the same problem (2) does with the `append/2` query. We can follow the same pattern of what we did with rule (2), and fix the non-equal check:\n\n```\n(3) change([H|T], [H|T2]) :- H \\== 2, change(T, T2).\n\n```\n\nSo we just carry over the element `H` if it's not a 2, then process the tails. The complete `change` predicate looks like:\n\n```\n(1) change([], []).\n(2) change([2|T], [4|T2]) :- change(T, T2).\n(3) change([H|T], [H|T2]) :- H \\== 2, change(T, T2).\n\n```\n\nRereading the rules, seeing that they make logical sense:\n\n1. Changing 2's to 4's in the empty list is the empty list.\n2. Changing 2's to 4's in the list `[2|T]` is the list `[4|T2]` *if* `T2` is the list `T` with the 2's changed to 4's.\n3. Changing 2's to 4's in the list `[H|T]` is the list `[H|T2]` *if* `H` is not `2` and `T2` is the list `T` with the 2's changed to 4's.",

        "answer": "There are many mistakes in your program.\n\nFor starters you are passing to the function an uninitialized pointer\n\n```\nchar *buf;\nchar *input = read_line(buf, 128);\n\n```\n\nIn fact there is no sense to pass the pointer value of which is not used in the function.\n\nWithin the function the variable c should be declared as having the type int.\n\n```\nint c;\n\n```\n\nOtherwise if the type char behaves as the type unsigned char (it depends on a compiler option) a comparison it with `EOF` will always evaluates to false.\n\nWithin the function the array tempBuf is not initialized. So this if statement\n\n```\nif (tempBuf[pos] == EOF || tempBuf[pos] == '\\n') {\n\n```\n\ninvokes undefined behavior.\n\nWithin the wjile llop you have to check that the value of `pos` is less than the value of `sz`. \n\nThe function returns a pointer to a local array that makes the returned pointer invalid.\n\n```\n  buf = tempBuf;\n  return buf;\n\n```\n\nMoreover the array even does not contain a string because the terminating zero is not appended to the array.\n\nThe function should allocate dynamically memory and return pointer to the allocated memory that will contain a zero terminated string.\n\nBelow there is a demonstrative program that shows how the function can be written.\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nchar * read_line( size_t n ) \n{\n    char *s = malloc( n );\n\n    if ( s != NULL )\n    {\n        int c;\n\n        printf( \"> \" );\n\n        size_t i = 0;\n\n        for ( ; i + 1 < n && ( c = getchar() ) != EOF && c != '\\n'; i++ )\n        {\n            s[i] = c;\n        }\n\n        s[i] = '\\0';\n    }\n\n    return s;\n}\n\nint main(void) \n{\n    size_t n = 128;\n\n    char *input = read_line( n );\n\n    if ( input != NULL ) printf( \"Here: %s\\n\", input );\n\n    free( input );\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nthe program output might look like\n\n```\n> Hello Jake Jackson\nHere: Hello Jake Jackson\n\n```",

        "question": "Using Django 1.7 migrations.\n\nI accidentally dropped a table in my database. I assumed that by running migration again this would recreate the table but no, Django states \"No migrations to apply\".\n\nHow to I get Django to recreate the table?\n\nI have run:\n\n```\n> makemigrations - No changes detected\n> migrate - No migrations to apply.\n\n```\n\nI have tried making a change to the model and running a new migration and it simply states that \"Table 'x.test\\_customer' doesn't exist\" which is correct, but what I was hoping it that it would recreate the table.",
        "answer": "Migrations check for differences in your models, then translates that to actions, which are translated to SQL. It **does not** automatically sync the db scheme with your models, and it has no way of knowing you dropped a table (it doesn't know about manual changes because, well, you're not supposed to do manual changes. That's the point)\n\nThe answer? a manual change requires *a manual migration as well*. What you need to do is simply write your own migration and manually tell south to re-build the table. It's not very difficult, [The docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/#squashing-migrations) make it pretty easy. Just make something like this:\n\n```\nfrom django.db import migrations, models\n\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\n\n    operations = [\n        migrations.CreateModel(\"Foo\"),\n        migrations.AddField(\"Foo\", \"bar\", models.IntegerField(default=0))\n    ] \n\n```\n\nYou can probably look into the first migration file (the one that made the model in the first place) and copy paste almost all of it. Then all you have to do is run the migration like you always do",

Bash arithmetic may not be adequate to handle the large numbers in your `nCk2` function. Eg, on a 32 bit system passing 10 to that function returns a *negative* number, -133461297271.\n\nTo handle the underflow issue you need to calculate at a larger scale, as mentioned in the other answers.

Rather than just piping commands into `bc` via `echo`, I've written a full `bc` script as a [*here* document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document) inside a Bash script, since that makes it easy to pass parameters from Bash to `bc`. \n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# Binomial probability calculations using bc\n# Written by PM 2Ring 2015.07.30\n\nn=144\np='1/72'\nm=16\nscale=30\n\nbc << EOF\ndefine ncr(n, r)\n{\n    auto v,i\n\n    v = 1\n    for(i=1; i<=r; i++)\n    {\n        v *= n--\n        v /= i\n    }\n    return v\n}\n\ndefine binprob(p, n, r)\n{\n    auto v\n\n    v = ncr(n, r)\n    v *= (1 - p) ^ (n - r)\n    v *= p ^ r\n    return v\n}\n\nsc = $scale\nscale = sc\noutscale = 8\n\nn = $n\np = $p\nm = $m\n\nfor(i=0; i<=m; i++)\n{\n    v = binprob(p, n, i)\n    scale = outscale\n    print i,\": \", v/1, \"\\n\"\n    scale = sc\n}\nEOF\n\n```\n\n**output**\n\n```\n0: .13345127\n1: .27066174\n2: .27256781\n3: .18171187\n4: .09021610\n5: .03557818\n6: .01160884\n7: .00322338\n8: .00077747\n9: .00016547\n10: .00003146\n11: .00000539\n12: .00000084\n13: .00000012\n14: .00000001\n15: 0\n16: 0\n\n```",
