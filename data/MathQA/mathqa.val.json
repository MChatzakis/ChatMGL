        "question": "a 3 - digit positive integer is chosen at random . what is the probability that the product of its digits is even ?",
        "answer": "The probability of obtaining a three-digit number with all odd digits is calculated as follows: The first digit cannot be zero, giving us a total of nine possible digits from which to choose. Of these nine digits, five are odd and four are even. Therefore, the probability of selecting an odd digit for the first slot is 5/9, the probability of selecting an odd digit for the second slot is 5/10 (since one digit has already been selected), and the probability of selecting an odd digit for the third slot is also 5/10. Multiplying these probabilities together yields 5/36.\n\nTo find the probability of obtaining at least one even digit, we can subtract the probability of obtaining all odd digits from one. Therefore, the probability of obtaining at least one even digit is 1 - 5/36, which simplifies to 31/36. Hence, the answer is 31/36."

        "answer": "The solution to the problem is as follows: Let m and n be the two numbers that satisfy the equation (1/m) + (1/n) = 2/35. Multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common multiple of m and n, we get (n + m)/mn = 2/35. Given that mn = 6 x 210 = 1260, we can substitute this value into the equation to get (n + m)/1260 = 2/35. Cross-multiplying, we obtain 35(n + m) = 2520, which simplifies to n + m = 72. Therefore, the answer is 2/35."

The probability, denoted as p, of selecting a person at random from the group who is under 20 years of age is calculated by dividing the number of individuals whose age is less than 20 by the total number of individuals in the group, which results in a value of 0.4375 or approximately 0.44.

        "answer": "One-third of the pieces of art are displayed, indicating that two-thirds of the pieces of art are not displayed. Furthermore, one-sixth of the pieces on display are sculptures, implying that five-sixths of the pieces on display are paintings. Additionally, one-third of the pieces not on display are paintings, indicating that two-thirds of the pieces not on display are sculptures. Given that there are 800 sculptures not on display, applying the third statement yields that two-thirds of the pieces not on display equals 800, resulting in a not on display count of 1200. Using the first statement, two-thirds of the total pieces equals 1200, yielding a total count of 1800. Therefore, the answer is 1800."

        "answer": "Sometimes, the answer choices for a given question provide a helpful indication of how to approach the problem. In this case, the problem can be solved through a process of elimination using simple arithmetic. The problem states that x and y are integers, and |x-y| = 10. The question asks for the minimum possible value of (x)(y). Since all of the answer choices are negative, one of the variables must be negative and the other must be positive. Therefore, we can restrict our work to those options. By testing various values of x and y, we find that the minimum value of xy is -25 when x = 5 and y = -5. Further work is not necessary, as xy will start to increase as x continues to decrease down to 1. Therefore, the final answer is -25."

The remaining overs were 40, and the team needed to score a total of 282 runs to win the match. To calculate the required run rate, we subtracted the runs scored in the first 10 overs from the total runs needed and obtained 220. We then assumed the required run rate to be x and multiplied it by the remaining overs, which gave us 40x. Equating 40x to 220, we obtained x = 220 / 40 = 5.5. Therefore, the required run rate for the team to win the match is 5.5 runs per over."

        "question": "a collection of books went on sale , and 2 / 3 of them were sold for $ 3.50 each . if none of the 40 remaining books were sold , what was the total amount received for the books that were sold ?",
        "answer": "Suppose the total number of books is represented by \"x\". From the given information, we know that 40 books constitute 1/3 of the total number of books, which can be expressed as:\n\n40 = (1/3)x\n\nSolving for \"x\", we get:\n\nx = 120\n\nNow, since 2/3 of the total number of books is equal to 80, we can express this as:\n\n(2/3)x = 80\n\nSolving for \"x\" again, we get:\n\nx = 120\n\nThis confirms that our initial assumption of \"x\" being the total number of books was correct.\n\nFinally, to find the amount received for the sold books, we multiply the number of sold books (80) by the price per book ($3.5), which gives:\n\nAmount received = 80 * 3.5 = $280\n\nTherefore, the answer is $280."

        "question": "excluding stoppages , the speed of a train is 60 kmph and including stoppages it is 40 kmph . of how many minutes does the train stop per hour ?",
        "answer": "The value of \"t\" can be calculated using the formula t = d/s, where \"d\" represents the distance traveled and \"s\" represents the speed. In this case, we have been given that the distance traveled is 20 km and the time taken is 60 minutes. \n\nTo convert the time taken from minutes to seconds, we need to multiply it by 60. Therefore, the time taken in seconds can be calculated as follows: \n\n60 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds \n\nNow, substituting the given values in the formula for \"t\", we get: \n\nt = d/s = 20 km / (3600 seconds/20 km) = 20/60 * 60 = 20 \n\nHence, the value of \"t\" is 20 seconds."

        "answer": "The formula used to calculate the percentage error in the calculated area is:\n\nPercentage error = [(Measured value - True value) / True value] x 100%\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nPercentage error = [(10 + 10 + (10 x 10)) / 100] x 100%\nPercentage error = (210 / 100) x 100%\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nPercentage error = 210%\n\nTherefore, the percentage error in the calculated area is 21%."

        "question": "if b is the center of the circle in the figure above and the area of the shaded region is 16 \u03c0 , what is the length of arc adc ?",
        "answer": "The given information states that the area of one-fourth of a circle is 16\u03c0, which can be used to determine that the total area of the circle is 64\u03c0. It follows that the radius of the circle is 8 units, and the circumference can be calculated as 2\u03c0 multiplied by the radius, which is equal to 16\u03c0. The length of arc ADC, which is one-fourth of the circumference, can be determined as 4\u03c0. Hence, the answer is 4\u03c0."

        "question": "in my , xiang sold 15 used cars . for these 15 used cars the range of selling prices was 15000 and the lowest selling price was 4500 . in june , xiang sold 10 cars . for these 10 cars the range of selling was 16000 and the lowest selling price was 5000 . what was the range of selling prices for the 25 used car sold by xiang in may and june ?",
        "answer": "The total cost for 10 cars is calculated as the sum of the fixed cost of $16,000 and the variable cost of $5,000, resulting in a total cost of $21,000. Similarly, the total cost for 15 cars is calculated as the sum of the fixed cost of $15,000 and the variable cost of $4,500, resulting in a total cost of $19,500. The minimum variable cost is $4,500, which is subtracted from the maximum total cost of $21,000, resulting in a minimum cost of $16,820. Therefore, the answer is $16,820."

        "question": "each digit 1 through 5 is used exactly once to create a 5 - digit integer . if the 3 and the 4 can not be adjacent digits in the integer , how many 5 - digit integers are possible ?",
        "answer": "The total number of 5-digit numbers that can be formed is equal to the factorial of 5, which is 120. The number of 5-digit numbers in which the digits 3 and 4 are adjacent is 48, which can be determined by considering the positions where they can appear as a pair. To calculate the number of 5-digit numbers in which the digits 3 and 4 are not adjacent, we subtract the number of 5-digit numbers in which they are adjacent from the total number of 5-digit numbers, resulting in 72."

        "question": "in a 200 m race , a beats b by 20 m and c by 38 m . in a race of 600 m b will beat c by",
        "answer": "The given statement implies that when A covers a distance of 200 meters, B covers a distance of 180 meters (200-20) and C covers a distance of 162 meters (200-38). Further, when C covers 162 meters, B covers 180 meters. Therefore, when B covers a distance of 600 meters, C covers 540 meters (162/180 x 600). Consequently, B beats C by a margin of 60 meters (600-540). Hence, the answer is 60 meters."
