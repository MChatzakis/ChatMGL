        "question": "a shopkeeper sold an article offering a discount of 5 % and earned a profit of 31.1 % . what would have been the percentage of profit earned if no discount had been offered ?",
        "answer": "If a seller decides not to offer any discounts to a customer, it indicates that the product will be sold at the printed price. Let us consider an example where the cost price of an article is 100. Using the formula, printed price = 100 x (100 + 31.1)/(100 - 5) = 138. Therefore, the required percentage profit would be 38%, which can be calculated as (printed price - cost price)/cost price x 100."

        "answer": "The problem requires us to determine the number of ways to select any two stations from a total of 30 stations, taking into consideration the direction of travel (i.e., the route from Hyderabad to Bangalore is distinct from the route from Bangalore to Hyderabad). This can be calculated using the permutation formula for selecting two objects from a set of 30, with an additional factor of 2 to account for the two possible directions of travel. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose two stations with direction of travel considered is 30P2 * 2 = 870. Hence, the final answer is 870."

        "answer": "Given that the initial population of a town is 3888 and the annual growth rate is 20%, we can calculate the required population after a certain number of years using the formula P = p / (1 + r/100)^t, where P is the required population, p is the initial population, r is the annual growth rate, and t is the number of years. By substituting the given values, we get P = 3888 / (1 + 20/100)^2, which simplifies to P = 2700 (approximately). Therefore, the required population of the town after two years is approximately 2700."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula: sell price = cost + profit. Given that the profit on one item is $20 and represents 10% of the cost, we can calculate the cost of each item to be $400. Thus, the sell price is $440 for each item. Selling all 100 items would give the retailer a profit of $2,000. \n\nIf the retailer offers a 5% discount on the sell price, then the new sell price becomes $418. This results in a profit of $18 per item sold. To earn a profit of $2,000, the retailer must sell 223 items. Selling 221 items would result in a profit of $1,989, which is not enough.

        "answer": "The bookshop initially had 10 hardback copies and 55 paperback copies. After selling 14 copies, there were 41 copies remaining. Let us denote the number of remaining paperback copies as 'p'. Thus, the number of remaining hardback copies is 41 - p. \n\nTo determine the number of paperback copies sold, we can use the fact that the bookshop sold a total of 14 copies. Therefore, the number of hardback copies sold is 14 - (41 - p) = p - 27. \n\nWe are given that the total revenue from selling these books was $460. We can set up an equation based on the prices of the hardback and paperback copies and the number sold: \n\n10(41 - p) + 20(p - 27) = 460 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n360 - 10p = 460 - 20p \n\nSolving for p, we get p = 36. \n\nTherefore, the number of paperback copies sold is 45 - 36 = 9."

Additionally, one-sixth of the pieces on display are sculptures, implying that five-sixths of the pieces on display are paintings. Furthermore, one-third of the pieces not on display are paintings, indicating that two-thirds of the pieces not on display are sculptures. Given that 1000 sculptures are not on display, according to the aforementioned information, it follows that two-thirds of the pieces not on display is equal to 1000, and thus the total number of pieces of art is 1500. Solving for two-thirds of the total number of pieces of art yields 1500, which implies that the total number of pieces of art is 2250. Therefore, the answer is 2250."

        "answer": "The solution to the problem involves the calculation of the time taken by a car to cover a distance of 50 meters when it accelerates from rest at a rate of 20 meters per second squared and then moves at a constant speed of 60 km/hr before decelerating at the same rate to come to a stop. \n\nThe initial speed of the car is zero, and the acceleration is 20 meters per second squared. Therefore, the time taken to reach a speed of 60 km/hr (or 16.67 m/s) can be calculated using the equation: \n\nv = u + at \n\nwhere v is the final speed, u is the initial speed, a is the acceleration, and t is the time taken. \n\nThus, t = (v - u) / a = (16.67 - 0) / 20 = 0.8333 seconds \n\nThe distance covered during this acceleration phase can be calculated using the equation: \n\ns = ut + 0.5at^2 \n\nwhere s is the distance covered. \n\nThus, s = 0 + 0.5 * 20 * (0.8333)^2 = 6.944 meters \n\nThe distance covered during the constant speed phase is simply: \n\ns = vt = 16.67 * (50 - 6.944) = 694.4 meters \n\nFinally, the time taken to decelerate from 60 km/hr to rest can be calculated using the same formula as before: \n\nt = (v - u) / a = (0 - 16.67) / -20 = 0.8333 seconds \n\nThe distance covered during this phase is: \n\ns = ut + 0.5at^2 = 0 + 0.5 * (-20) * (0.8333)^2 = 6.944 meters \n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by the car is 694.4 + 6.944 + 6.944 = 708.288 meters. \n\nThe average speed of the car for the entire journey is: \n\naverage speed = total distance / total time = 708.288 / (0.8333 + 50 + 0.8333) = 13.15 m/s \n\nHence, the time taken by the car to cover a distance of 50 meters is: \n\ntime taken = distance / speed = 50 / 13.15 = 3.803 seconds (to three decimal places)."

        "question": "three walls have wallpaper covering a combined area of 300 square meters . by overlapping the wallpaper to cover a wall with an area of 180 square meters , the area that is covered by exactly two layers of wallpaper is 34 square meters . what is the area that is covered with three layers of wallpaper ?",
        "answer": "The computation reveals that there is an overlap of 120 square meters of wallpaper, which can be present in either two or three layers. Given that 36 square meters of the wallpaper has two layers, the remaining overlap in three layers is 120 - 34 = 86 square meters. Since 86 square meters of wallpaper creates two additional layers, it follows that the area over which it creates two extra layers is 43 square meters. Therefore, the answer is 43 square meters."

        "question": "a meeting has to be conducted with 6 managers . find the number of ways in which the managers may be selected from among 9 managers , if there are 2 managers who refuse to attend the meeting together .",
        "answer": "The solution to the problem involves determining the number of ways in which 6 managers can be chosen from a pool of 9 managers. This is achieved using the combination formula, which gives 9C6 = 84. However, since the question requires the exclusion of groups that include two specific managers, the number of such groups is calculated as 7C4 = 35. The final step involves subtracting the number of groups including the two managers from the total number of possible groups, giving 84 - 35 = 49. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 49."

        "question": "a trader bought a car at 20 % discount on its original price . he sold it at a 40 % increase on the price he bought it . what percent of profit did he make on the original price ?",
        "answer": "Let the original price be denoted as 'P', which is equal to 100 cents (cp) or 80 shillings (s). \n\nGiven that the selling price is 140% of the original price, we can calculate the selling price as: \n\nselling price = P * (140/100) = 112 shillings\n\nTherefore, the discount given is the difference between the original price and the selling price: \n\ndiscount = P - selling price = 80 - 112 = -32 shillings\n\nHowever, since a discount cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the discount: \n\ndiscount = |-32| = 32 shillings\n\nTo express the discount as a percentage of the original price, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: \n\ndiscount percentage = (32/80) * 100 = 40%\n\nTherefore, the formal answer is that a discount of 40% was given."

        "question": "a start walking from a place at a uniform speed of 6 kmph in a particular direction . after half an hour , b starts from the same place and walks in the same direction as a at a uniform speed and overtakes a after 1 hour 48 minutes . find the speed of b .",
        "answer": "The distance covered by person A in 30 minutes is 1 kilometer. Person B covers an additional distance of 1 kilometer in 1 hour and 48 minutes (9/5 hours), resulting in a relative speed of B over A of 1/(9/5) or 5/9. Thus, the speed of person B is equal to the speed of person A plus 5/9. Substituting the given value of 6 kilometers per hour for person A's speed yields a value of 6 + 5/9 or 6.55 kilometers per hour for person B's speed. Therefore, the answer is 6.6 kilometers per hour."

        "answer": "The division of 2 km by 400 m results in a quotient of 5. However, it should be noted that the street located at the 2-km mark is not the fifth street, but rather Maple Street. Thus, the maximum numbered street in this scenario is the fourth street. Therefore, the answer is the fourth street."
