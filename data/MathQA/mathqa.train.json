        "answer": "Typically, problems of this nature can be resolved by selecting a suitable value for the variable and deducing the value of other associated variables. For instance, let us assume that p is equal to 400. Subsequently, j can be calculated to be (75/100)*400=300. Additionally, j is also equivalent to (80/100)*t, implying that t can be calculated as (300*100)/80=375. Furthermore, t can be expressed as [1-(q/100)]*p. Substituting the calculated values, we obtain 100-q= (100*375)/400=93.75, giving q=6.25. Thus, the answer is 6.25."

Therefore, the total number of feet can be expressed as 2h + 4c = 144, which simplifies to h + 2c = 72. \n\nWe can then solve the system of equations by eliminating one variable. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives h + 2c - (h + c) = 72 - 50, which simplifies to c = 22. \n\nSubstituting this value of c into the first equation gives h + 22 = 50, which simplifies to h = 28.

The problem provides the following information: \n\n- A distance of 96 km was traveled in an unknown amount of time, with a speed of 8 kmph.\n- Another distance of 40 km was traveled in an unknown amount of time, with a speed of 8 kmph.\n- The time taken to travel a certain distance is denoted by \"?\"\n- The time taken to travel a certain distance is the same for both cases and is denoted by \"s\".\n\nTo solve the problem, we first need to find the time taken to travel each distance. We can use the formula: \n\ntime = distance / speed \n\nFor the first case, we have: \n\ntime = 96 / 8 = 12 hours \n\nFor the second case, we have: \n\ntime = 40 / 8 = 5 hours \n\nSince the time taken to travel a certain distance is the same for both cases, we can set them equal to each other: \n\n12 hours = 5 hours + ?\n\nSolving for \"?\", we get: \n\n? = 12 - 5 = 7 hours \n\nFinally, we can use the formula: \n\nspeed = distance / time \n\nto find the speed in kmph. We have: \n\ns = 96 / 7 = 13.71 kmph \n\nand \n\ns = 40 / 7 = 5.71 kmph \n\nTaking the average of these two speeds, we get: \n\ns = (13.71 + 5.71) / 2 = 9.71 kmph \n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is: \n\ns = 9.71 kmph"

        "answer": "According to the given information, Vinoth can complete a painting work in one day at a rate of 1/20 and Prakash can complete the same work in one day at a rate of 1/25. When they work together, they can complete the work in 9/100 (1/20 + 1/25) days. Therefore, the total time they took to complete the work is (9/100) * 3 = 27/100 days. The remaining work to be done is 73/100 which Prakash needs to complete. As Prakash can complete one work in 25 days, he can complete 73/100 work in (73/100) * 25 = 73/4 or 18.25 days.

        "answer": "Given that triangles ABC and ADE are similar, it follows that the ratio of the length of a side of triangle ABC to the length of the corresponding side of triangle ADE is equal to the square root of the ratio of their areas. In this case, we are given that the square of this ratio is equal to 25/169. Therefore, we can simplify the ratio of the length of the side of triangle ABC to the length of the corresponding side of triangle ADE to 5/13. Since we know that the length of side DE is equal to the length of the corresponding side of triangle ADE, we can conclude that the length of DE is equal to 5/13 times the length of the corresponding side of triangle ABC. Therefore, if the length of the corresponding side of triangle ABC is 14 (as implied by the original answer), then the length of DE would be 5/13 times 14, which simplifies to 5. Hence, the length of DE is 5."

        "answer": "The exam presents a number that is easily divisible by 7 to engage students in calculating actual numbers and to ensure the correct ratio. As the question concerns percentages, the actual numbers are irrelevant, and only the ratio holds significance. However, for those who are curious, each 1/7 portion represents 2,030 employees, and thus, there are 4,060 journeymen and 10,150 full-time workers. If half of the journeymen are laid off, 1/7 of the total workforce would be removed. This leads some students to believe that the remaining journeymen would constitute half of what they used to be, which is 1/7 of the total workforce. However, this is a tempting but incorrect answer choice. The difference between the initial statement and the final tally is that the total number of workers decreased by 1/7. Thus, the remaining workforce is still 1/7 of the initial workers, but the composition has changed. The new workforce is smaller than the initial group, specifically 6/7 of it as 1/7 was eliminated. Therefore, the remaining workers account for 1/7 out of 6/7 of the force, which is 1 out of 6 or 16.67% when multiplied by 100. The answer works with both percentages and absolute numbers, but percentage calculation is faster and applicable to similar situations. The underlying principle of percentages and ratios is that the relative proportions remain the same, regardless of the actual numbers involved."

        "answer": "Assuming that the length of the plot is represented by 'l' meters, the breadth can be expressed as 'l-20' meters. The perimeter of the given plot can be calculated as 2 times the sum of length and breadth, which results in 2[l + (l-20)] = [4l-40] meters. Multiplying this result by the given rate of 26.50, we get 7420 as the cost. Solving for 'l', we get 280 as [4l-40]. Dividing this by 26.50, we obtain a value of 80 for 'l'. Hence, the length of the plot is 80 meters."

        "answer": "The calculation involves determining the duration required to complete a certain amount of work given a specific number of workers. The total work to be done is calculated by multiplying 30 and 40, which yields 1200. Assuming that 12 men leave the work after a certain number of days, denoted as 'p', the remaining work is completed in 40 days after they leave. This implies that the work done by the 12 men in p days is equivalent to the work that would have been completed in 40 days. By applying the principle of proportionality, the equation 40p + (12*40) = 1200 is derived. Solving for 'p' yields 18 days. Therefore, the answer is 18 days."

        "answer": "The speed of the train relative to the man is calculated as 30 km/h (the speed of the train with respect to the ground) added to 3 km/h (the speed of the man with respect to the ground), which yields a total of 33 km/h. This speed can be converted to meters per second by multiplying by 1000/3600. Thus, the speed of the train relative to the man is (33*1000)/3600 = 9.1667 m/s (to four decimal places). \n\nTo determine the time it takes for the train to pass the man, we divide the length of the train (110 m) by the speed of the train relative to the man (9.1667 m/s), which yields 12 seconds. Therefore, the formal answer is that the train will take 12 seconds to pass the man."

The length of the train is determined by multiplying the speed by the time taken to pass a stationary observer, which is 12 seconds. Therefore, the length of the train is calculated as 15 multiplied by 12, resulting in 180 meters. Assuming the length of the platform is represented by x meters, the time taken for the train to pass the platform and the observer is calculated as the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform, divided by the speed of the train. Equating this time to 15 seconds, the time taken for the train to pass the observer, the value of x is calculated as 270 meters. Therefore, the length of the platform is 270 meters."

Therefore, in the given situation where a right triangle is inscribed in a circle with sides measuring 6 and 8 units, the diameter of the circle can be determined by applying the Pythagorean theorem. The diameter is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides, which is equal to (6^2 + 8^2)^1/2.

Firstly, the sum of the first 41 integers starting from 100, which gives 100 multiplied by 41. Secondly, the sum of the even numbers from 2 to 80, which can be expressed as twice the sum of the first 40 integers, giving 2 multiplied by the sum of integers from 1 to 40. This can be further simplified to 2 multiplied by 40 multiplied by 41 divided by 2, which is equal to 40 multiplied by 41. \n\nCombining the two parts, we get 100 multiplied by 41 plus 40 multiplied by 41, which equals 140 multiplied by 41.

        "answer": "The total sales for the week can be calculated as follows: sales during 7 regular days is 7 multiplied by 32 multiplied by x, which equals 224x. Sales during 3 hot days is 3 multiplied by 32 multiplied by 1.25x, which equals 120x. Therefore, the total sales for the week would be 224x + 120x = 344x. The total cost of the week is calculated as 10 multiplied by 32 multiplied by 0.75, which equals 240. The profit would be the difference between the total sales and the total cost, which equals 344x - 240 = 450. Solving for x, we get x = 2. Thus, 1.25x would be approximately 2.50.

Then, the probability of another member of the same party being chosen for the second spot is 24/49, since there are 24 remaining members of that party out of a total of 49 candidates. It does not matter which party or which person obtains the first spot, so the probability can also be calculated as (25/50). This result can occur for both parties, and therefore the probability of one party obtaining both spots is (12/49) + (12/49) = (24/49). Thus, the answer is 24/49."

The compound interest is given by ci = a - p. \n\nSubstituting the given values, we obtain the equation 993 = p(1 + r/100)^3 - p. Solving for 'p', we get p = 3000/-. \n\nNext, we need to calculate the simple interest on the principal amount of Rs. 3000/- for a period of 2 years at the rate of 10%. Using the formula for simple interest, we get (3000 x 10 x 2)/100 = 600/-. \n\nTherefore, the answer is Rs. 600/-."

        "answer": "The solution involves determining the average price of two varieties mixed in equal proportions and then using this average to find the price of a third variety in the mixture. The average price is calculated using the formula rs. (126 + 135/2) = rs. 130.50. The mixture is formed by mixing two varieties in a 1:1 ratio, one at rs. 130.50 per kg and the other at an unknown price of rs. x per kg. To determine the value of x, the equation x-163/22.50 = 1 is solved, resulting in x = 185.50. Therefore, the price of the third variety is rs. 175.50 per kg. The final answer is rs. 185.50."

        "answer": "Let 'r' be the radius of the smaller circle and 'R' be the radius of the larger circle. Therefore, the circumference of the smaller circle is 2\u03c0r and the circumference of the larger circle is 2\u03c0R. Since the sum of their circumferences is 49, we can write the equation as follows: 2\u03c0r + 2\u03c0R = 49. \n\nGiven that 2r = R, we can substitute R with 2r in the above equation, which gives 2\u03c0r + 4\u03c0r = 49. Simplifying further, we get 6\u03c0r = 49. \n\nBy dividing both sides by 6\u03c0, we obtain r \u2248 2.6. Substituting this value of 'r' in the equation 2r + 2\u03c0r = 49, we get 2(2.6) + 2\u03c0(2.6) = 49. \n\nThis simplifies to 7.8 + 5.2\u03c0 = 49. Therefore, the formal answer is R + r \u2248 7.8."

        "answer": "1) The cost of repairing the old shoe for one year is $10.5. Therefore, the cost of repairing it for two years would be $21.\n\n2) The cost of purchasing a new pair of shoes that will last for two years is $30. To calculate the percentage change between the cost of repairing the old shoe and the cost of purchasing a new pair of shoes, we use the formula: (final value - initial value) / (initial value) * 100. In this case, the final value is the price of the new shoe, and the initial value is the cost of repairing the old shoe. Thus, the percentage change is (30 - 21) / (21) * 100 = 42.85%. Therefore, the percentage change is 42.85."

Therefore, the net part filled in one hour is (1/4 - 1/6) = 1/12. \n\nThe time required to fill the entire cistern can be obtained by taking the reciprocal of the net part filled in one hour. Thus, the cistern will be filled in 12/1 hours, which simplifies to 12 hours. \n\nTherefore, the formal answer to this problem is that the cistern will be filled in 12.0 hours."

        "answer": "Given that 30% of the boys from school A study science, it can be inferred that 70% of the boys from school A do not study science. Further, as 20% of the total number of boys are from school A, it follows that 14% of the boys in the camp are from school A and do not study science (0.2 x 0.7 = 0.14 or 14%). The given value of 56 represents the number of boys from school A who do not study science. Therefore, 0.14 multiplied by the total number of boys in the camp is equal to 56. Thus, the total number of boys in the camp is equal to 400. Hence, the formal answer is 400."

        "answer": "Consider a weather pattern consisting of four consecutive days, where each day can either be rainy or not rainy. One particular weather pattern has the sequence of rainy, rainy, rainy, not rainy. The probability of this specific weather pattern occurring is calculated by taking the probability of a single day being rainy (which is 1/2) and raising it to the power of 4, since there are four days in the pattern. Therefore, the probability of this specific weather pattern is (1/2)^4 = 1/16. \n\nThe question asks for the probability of exactly three rainy days occurring in any of the possible weather patterns. To determine this, we need to calculate the total number of possible weather patterns that have exactly three rainy days. This can be done by using the formula for combinations, where we choose 3 days out of 4 to be rainy. This is denoted as 4 C 3, which equals 4. Therefore, there are 4 possible weather patterns that have exactly three rainy days. \n\nTo find the probability of any one of these weather patterns occurring, we multiply the probability of each individual pattern (which we calculated earlier as 1/16) by the number of possible patterns (which we just determined to be 4). This gives us a probability of 4/16, which simplifies to 1/4. \n\nHence, the probability of exactly three rainy days occurring in any of the possible weather patterns is 1/4."

Therefore, the speed of the train is 17.5 m/s. \n\nIf the length of the train is 20 times the speed of the train, then it can be calculated by multiplying the speed of the train by 20. Hence, the length of the train is 350 m. \n\nAssuming the length of the platform to be x meters, the total distance travelled by the train and the platform is (x + 350) meters. The time taken by the train to cover this distance is equal to the length of the platform divided by the speed of the train plus the time taken by the train to pass the platform. As the train passes the platform, the distance travelled is equal to the length of the train plus the length of the platform. \n\nUsing the above information, the equation can be written as (x + 350)/36 = 17.5.

        "answer": "Machine B takes x hours to produce 330 sprockets, while machine A takes (x+10) hours to produce the same number of sprockets. In one hour, machine B produces 330/x sprockets, and machine A produces 330/(x+10) sprockets. Equating the production rates gives 1.1(330/(x+10)) = 330/x, which simplifies to 484/(x+10) = 330/x. Solving for x yields x=100, which means machine A produces 330/(x+10) = 3 sprockets per hour. Therefore, the answer is 3."

        "answer": "After 60 minutes of rotation, the minute hand will form a 30-degree angle with the hour hand. Let the time required for an overtaking maneuver be 't' minutes. In this time, the angle covered by the minute hand can be calculated as (360/60) t = 6t. Similarly, the angle covered by the hour hand can be calculated as (30/60) t = t/2. For an overtaking maneuver, 6t = 30 + t/2. Solving for 't', we get t = 60/11 minutes, which is equal to 5 minutes and 5/11 minutes or 5 minutes and 300/11 seconds or 5 minutes and 27.273 seconds.

        "answer": "Based on the given information, it can be inferred that a village loses 10 liters of water per day, resulting in a total loss of 150 liters over a period of 15 days. This suggests that the daily water consumption of the village is 30 liters per day. Therefore, the capacity of the water tank can be calculated as 30 liters per day multiplied by 20 days, which equals 600 liters. Considering the village loses an additional 20 liters per day, the total daily water loss becomes 50 liters. Consequently, the supply of water in the tank would last for 12 days, which is the result of dividing the total tank capacity of 600 liters by the daily water loss of 50 liters. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 12 days."

If x = 20 and y = 10, then the total number of black-and-white films is 20 x = 400 and the total number of color films is 6 y = 60. Thus, y / x% = 10 / 20% = 0.5%. Therefore, 0.5% of the black-and-white films is 2 films, and all 60 color films were selected, making a total of 62 films. Consequently, the color films constitute x = 60 / 62 = 30 / 31 of the selected films. Thus, the answer is 30 / 31."

It is observed that there exists an indirect proportion between the number of persons and the number of days required to complete the work, i.e., less number of persons will result in more number of days required to complete the work. Similarly, there exists an indirect proportion between the number of working hours per day and the number of days required to complete the work, i.e., more working hours per day will result in less number of days required to complete the work. \n\nGiven that 30 persons can complete the work in 6 hours per day, and 39 persons can complete the work in 5 hours per day. We can use the concept of proportionality to solve for the number of days required to complete the work with 12 persons working. \n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n30 : 39 :: 12 : x (number of persons)\n6 : 5 :: x : y (number of working hours per day)\n\nCross multiplying these proportions, we get:\n\n30x6x = 39x5y\n\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\n\nx = (39 x 5 x 24) / (30 x 6) = 26\n\nThus, we observe that it will take 26 days for 12 persons to complete the work if they work for 8 hours per day."

Thus, the CP of one liter of mixture from vessel B is Rs. 7/13. The required quantity of spirit in one liter of mixture from vessel C is 8/13. The mean price, i.e., the CP of one liter of mixture from vessel C is Rs. 8/13. Therefore, the ratio of the mixture from vessel A to that of vessel B is 7:9 or 1/13:9/91. Hence, the answer is 7:9."

        "answer": "Let \"x\" denote the radius of object \"b\" and \"2h\" denote its height. Thus, the radius of object \"c\" is equal to \"2x\" and its height is \"h\". The volume of object \"b\" can be calculated using the formula 3.14 * x^2 * 2h, and the volume of object \"a\" can be calculated using the formula 3.14 * 4x^2 * h. The cost to fill half of object \"b\" is $4, which implies that the cost to fill the entire object \"b\" is $8. Solving for the equation 3.14 * x^2 * 2h = 8 yields 3.14 * x^2 * h = 4.

        "answer": "Let us consider the ages of Richard, David, and Scott as 'r', 'd', and 's' respectively. Given that Richard is 6 years older than David, we can express this as r=d+6. It is also given that David is 8 years older than Scott, which can be expressed as d=s+8. We are then told that in 8 years, Richard will be twice as old as Scott, which can be expressed as r+8=2(s+8). Simplifying this equation, we get r+8=2s+16, which can be further simplified to r=2s+8. \n\nHowever, we also know that r=d+6=(s+8)+6=s+14. Equating the two expressions for 'r', we get 2s+8=s+14, which gives us s=6. Substituting this value of 's' in r=2s+8, we get r=20. Similarly, substituting s=6 in d=s+8, we get d=14. \n\nTo find out how old David was 3 years ago, we need to subtract 3 years from his current age, which is d-3=14-3=11. Therefore, David was 11 years old 3 years ago."

We can represent their present ages as 6x + 10 and 5x + 10 for Vimal and Saroj respectively. Setting up the ratio equation, we get:\n\n(6x + 10):(5x + 10) = 11:10\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 2.

Therefore, we can write the equation \u03c0r^2 = 25\u03c0. Simplifying this equation, we get r^2 = 25, which implies that r = 5 feet.\n\nThe formula for calculating the circumference of a circle is given by C = 2\u03c0r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. Substituting the value of r as 5 feet, we get C = 2\u03c0(5) = 10\u03c0 feet. Hence, the correct answer is 10\u03c0 feet."

        "answer": "To obtain a positive product from two numbers, it is necessary that both numbers have the same sign - either both must be positive or both must be negative. The probability of obtaining a positive product when both numbers are positive is calculated as p(positive, positive) = 2/5 * 2/4 = 4/20. The same probability is obtained when both numbers are negative, i.e., p(negative, negative) = 2/5 * 2/4 = 4/20. Therefore, the total probability of obtaining a positive product is the sum of the probabilities obtained from both cases, i.e., p = 4/20 + 4/20 = 8/20 = 2/5. Hence, the answer is 2/5."

        "answer": "The relative speed between two objects is the sum of their individual speeds, which in this case is 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr, resulting in a relative speed of 100 km/hr. This can be converted to meters per second by multiplying by 5/18, resulting in a relative speed of 250/9 m/sec. \n\nThe distance covered by the two objects when crossing each other is the sum of their individual distances, which is 140m and 210m, resulting in a total distance of 350m. \n\nTo calculate the required time for the two objects to cross each other, we divide the total distance by the relative speed, resulting in a time of 12.6 seconds.

John can make 5 donuts per hour alone, given that 10 divided by 2 equals 5. John and David together can make 10 donuts per hour, which means David contributes 5 donuts per hour. To determine the percentage, David's rate of production is multiplied by 1 hour, resulting in 5 donuts per hour. Thus, David's percentage of contribution is calculated by dividing 5 donuts by the total production of 10 donuts, which equals 1/2 or 50%."

        "answer": "To calculate the time taken by the train to pass a platform, we first convert the given speed in kilometers per hour to meters per second. The conversion factor for this is 1 km/hr = 1 * (5/18) m/s. Therefore, the speed of the train is 132 * (5/18) = 110/3 m/s. \n\nTo determine the distance that needs to be covered in passing the platform, we add the length of the train and the length of the platform. This gives a total distance of 110 + 165 = 275 meters. \n\nFinally, we can calculate the time taken by dividing the distance by the speed. Thus, the time taken by the train to pass the platform is 275 * 3 / 110 = 15/2 = 7.5 seconds. Therefore, the answer is 7.5 seconds."

        "answer": "An alternate, more efficient solution involves reducing the time required to complete the task from 12 hours to 8 hours. As the machines operate at a constant rate, this reduction in time necessitates an increase in the rate of production. Specifically, the new rate must be 3/2 times the original rate in order to complete the task in the reduced time of 8 hours. Given an original rate of 10 machines, this results in a required rate of 15 machines. Subtracting the original 10 machines from the required 15 machines yields the answer of 5 additional machines needed to complete the task in 8 hours. Therefore, the answer is 5."

        "answer": "The use of approximation in GMAT questions is only appropriate when explicitly stated. In this particular problem, the answer is not precisely 5, but rather very close to 4.54. Given that jar y has 10% more marbles than jar x (y=1.1x), if k marbles are taken out of y, the remaining number of marbles in jar y is 1.1x - k. If k marbles are added to jar x, the new count of marbles in jar x is x + k, and since they are equal, x + k = 1.1x - k. Solving for k, we find that k = 0.05x, which represents the number of marbles taken out of jar y. To determine what percentage of the original number of marbles in jar y this represents, we calculate (0.05x / 1.1x) * 100, which simplifies to 4.54%. Therefore, the answer to the question is 4.54%."

        "question": "if x and y are integers and | x - y | = 11 , what is the minimum possible value of xy ?",
        "answer": "Sometimes, the answer choices for a given question can provide useful information for solving it. In this case, the prompt can be solved without complex mathematical concepts by using brute force. We are given that x and y are integers and that |x - y| = 11. We are asked to find the minimum possible value of (x)(y). Since all of the answer choices are negative, we can deduce that one of the variables must be negative and the other must be positive.\n\nWe can then test out different values of x and y that satisfy the given equation and restrict our work to negative values of x. By doing so, we find that the minimum value of (x)(y) is -30 when x = 5 and y = -6. As x continues to decrease down to 1, the value of (x)(y) will start to increase, so no further calculations are necessary. Therefore, the final answer is -30."

        "question": "a train 75 m long takes 6 sec to cross a man walking at 5 kmph in a direction opposite to that of the train . find the speed of the train ?",
        "answer": "Let the speed of the train be denoted by x kmph. The speed of the train relative to the man is given by the expression (x + 5) kmph. Converting this speed into meters per second, we obtain (x + 5) * 5/18 m/s. The time taken for the train to cross the man is 6 seconds. \n\nHence, we can write the equation 75 / [(x + 5) * 5/18] = 6, where 75 meters is the distance covered by the train while crossing the man. Solving for x, we obtain x = 40 kmph. Therefore, the speed of the train is 40 kmph."

        "question": "two trains , each 100 m long , moving in opposite directions , cross other in 5 sec . if one is moving twice as fast the other , then the speed of the faster train is ?",
        "answer": "Let the speed of the slower train be x meters per second. Then, the speed of the faster train is 2x meters per second. The relative speed between the two trains is the sum of their speeds, which is (x + 2x) = 3x meters per second. \n\nGiven that the distance between the two trains is 200 meters and the time taken for them to cross each other is 5 seconds, we can use the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time to get:\n\n200 = 3x \u00d7 5\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 20/3 meters per second\n\nConverting this to kilometers per hour, we get:\n\n(20/3) \u00d7 (18/5) = 42 kilometers per hour\n\nTherefore, the speed of the faster train is 42 kilometers per hour."

        "question": "the consumption of diesel per hour of a bus varies directly as square of its speed . when the bus is travelling at 60 kmph its consumption is 1 litre per hour . if each litre costs $ 60 and other expenses per hous is $ 60 , then what would be the minimum expenditure required to cover a distance of 600 km ?",
        "answer": "At a speed of 60 kilometers per hour, the fuel consumption rate is 1 liter per hour. Therefore, covering a distance of 600 kilometers will take 10 hours and require a total of 10 liters of fuel. Since the cost of one liter of fuel is $60, the total cost of the fuel for the entire distance will be $600. Additionally, the cost of one extra hour of travel is $60, and since the total travel time is 10 hours, the cost of the extra hour is $600. Thus, the total expense for the trip, including the fuel and the extra hour, is $1200."

        "answer": "The solution to the given problem is as follows: \n\nLet w = 62 and l = 38. \n\nThus, 62 % 38 = 24. \n\nNext, we are given that 24 % 288 = 24. \n\nTo find the value of 62 % 744, we need to simplify it step-by-step. \n\nFirstly, we can write 62 as 744 * 0.0833 (since 62 is 8.33% of 744). \n\nThus, 62 % 744 = (744 * 0.0833) % 744. \n\nSimplifying this expression, we get: \n\n(744 * 0.0833) % 744 = (62.232) % 744 = 62.232 - 744 * floor(62.232/744) = 62.232 - 744 * 0 = 62.232. \n\nTherefore, the value of 62 % 744 is 62.232 (rounded to three decimal places)."

        "question": "there are 17 teams in the hockey league , and each team faces all the other teams 10 times each . how many games are played in the season ?",
        "answer": "The solution involves calculating the number of ways to choose two teams from a total of 17 teams, which is given by the combination formula 17 choose 2, denoted by 17C2. This can be simplified as 17*16/2, yielding a value of 136. The total number of games in the season is calculated by multiplying the number of possible team combinations by the number of games each combination can play, which is 10. Therefore, the total number of games in the season is 10*136 = 1360. Hence, the final answer is 1360."
