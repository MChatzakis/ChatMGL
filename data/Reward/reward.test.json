        "question": "Let $f_{\\mathrm{MLP}}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be an $L$-hidden layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) such that $$ f_{\\mathrm{MLP}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{L} \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{L-1} \\ldots \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{1} \\mathbf{x}\\right)\\right)\\right) $$ with $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M}, \\mathbf{W}_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times d}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{\\ell} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times M}$ for $\\ell=2, \\ldots, L$, and $\\sigma$ is an entry-wise activation function. Also, let $f_{\\mathrm{CNN}}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be an $L^{\\prime}$-hidden layer convolutional neural network (CNN) such that $$ f_{\\mathrm{CNN}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{w}^{\\top} \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{L^{\\prime}} \\star \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{L^{\\prime}-1} \\star \\ldots \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{w}_{1} \\star \\mathbf{x}\\right)\\right)\\right) $$ with $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\mathbf{w}_{\\ell} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K}$ for $\\ell=1, \\ldots, L^{\\prime}$ and $\\star$ denoting the one-dimensional convolution operator with zero-padding, i.e., output of the convolution has the same dimensionality as the input. Let's assume $\\sigma$ is a tanh activation function. Thus, by flipping the signs of all of the weights leading in and out of a hidden neuron, the input-output mapping function represented by the network is unchanged. Besides, interchanging the values of all of the weights (i.e., by permuting the ordering of the hidden neurons within the layer) also leaves the network input-output mapping function unchanged. Suppose that, given the training data, SGD can find a solution with zero training loss, and the (absolute value) weights of such solution are non-zero and all unique. Choose the largest lower bound on the number of solutions (with zero training loss) achievable by $f_{\\mathrm{MLP}}$ with $L=1$ and $M$ hidden units on this dataset.$M! 2^M$, $1$, $2^M$, $M !$,",
        "answer": "By changing the signs of a particular group of weights, the input-output mapping function represented by the network is unchanged. Thus, any given weight vector will be one of a set of $2^{M}$ equivalent weight vectors.\nSimilarly, interchanging the values of all of the weights also leaves the network input-output mapping function unchanged, thus for $M$ hidden units, any given weight vector will belong to a set of $M$ ! equivalent weight vectors.\nThe network will therefore have an overall weight-space symmetry factor of $M ! 2^{M}$."

        "answer": "We are asked to study the limit of a given function as $x$ approaches $0$, depending on the parameters $a$ and $b$. To do so, we first define two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that appear in the limit expression. We then apply L'H\u00f4pital's rule twice to find that the limit is of the form \" $\\frac{0}{0}$\". Finally, we compute the second derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and use them to evaluate the limit of their quotient. This gives us three possible cases for the limit, depending on whether $a$ and $b$ are equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ or not. We summarize our findings in a piecewise function that gives the limit as a function of $a$ and $b$."

        "question": "I am using Singular Value Decomposition as a dimensionality reduction technique.\n\nGiven `N` vectors of dimension `D`, the idea is to represent the features in a transformed space of uncorrelated dimensions, which condenses most of the information of the data in the eigenvectors of this space in a decreasing order of importance.\n\nNow I am trying to apply this procedure to time series data. The problem is that not all the sequences have the same length, thus I cant really build the `num-by-dim` matrix and apply SVD. My first thought was to pad the matrix with zeros by building a `num-by-maxDim` matrix and filling the empty spaces with zeros, but I'm not so sure if that is the correct way.\n\nMy question is how do you the SVD approach of dimensionality reduction to time series of different length? Alternatively are there any other similar methods of eigenspace representation usually used with time series?\n\nBelow is a piece of MATLAB code to illustrate the idea:\n\n```\nX = randn(100,4);                       % data matrix of size N-by-dim\n\nX0 = bsxfun(@minus, X, mean(X));        % standarize\n[U S V] = svd(X0,0);                    % SVD\nvariances = diag(S).^2 / (size(X,1)-1); % variances along eigenvectors\n\nKEEP = 2;                               % number of dimensions to keep\nnewX = U(:,1:KEEP)*S(1:KEEP,1:KEEP);    % reduced and transformed data\n\n```\n\n(I am coding mostly in MATLAB, but I'm comfortable enough to read R/Python/.. as well)",

        "question": "I've extended the wifi in my home with a second wifi access point (AP) router, *wired* to the main one. The two routers are configured with the same encryption settings, same subnet, and same dhcp pool.\n\nTheir antennas are on non-overlapping channels, and they are configured with *separate* SSIDs (e.g. HOME-24G-*ext* vs HOME-24G). Would reconfiguring the extension router to use the main's SSID affect anything w.r.t. the AP-roaming decisions of modern phones and computers (in 2018)?\n\nWith separate SSIDs, I will sometimes witness wifi clients hanging on to a weaker signal on the main, and *not* automatically switch to the other extension SSID (or vice versa). So, I'm wondering if uniting the SSIDs would facilitate transitions to the AP with a slightly stronger signal.\n\n*Note 1:* This is related to this question on [same vs. different SSIDs](https://superuser.com/questions/1215392/dual-band-wifi-router-to-dual-band-extender-can-should-i-use-a-single-ssid-name), but not quite the same. My two routers are wired, so I don't think that the issue where *\"clients hang on to a stronger repeater signal when better performance would be achieved on the main router (despite a weaker signal there)\"* applies.\n\n*Note 2:* WDS wasn't an option -- The main router doesn't support it.\n\n*Note 3:* My setup: the extension router is wired from a LAN-port to a LAN-port of the main router. And dhcp is handled only by the main router. This is called \"[Bridged AP](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/bridgedap)\" in OpenWrt parlance.",
        "answer": "Wi-Fi clients generally have a \"roaming threshold\", which is a signal strength (RSSI) value below which the client will consider its current AP to be too far away, and start doing scans to find a better AP to roam to. If it finds any other APs publishing the same SSID, the alternative AP with the highest RSSI must be enough better than the current AP's RSSI to be worth roaming to (to avoid thrashing/flapping back and forth between two equally bad APs).\n\nScanning is expensive, especially if you have to look for hidden SSIDs or scan DFS channels, so some clients may choose to do quickie roam scans that are less likely to find APs publishing hidden SSIDs or APs on DFS channels. So for best results, be sure to broadcast your SSID, and put your APs on non-DFS channels."

        "answer": "The given linear program is a maximization problem with three constraints and five variables. The variables are $x_1$, $x_2$, $s_1$, $s_2$, and $s_3$. We can use the Simplex method to solve this problem by constructing a Simplex tableau and performing pivot operations until we reach the optimal solution.\n\nThe given Simplex tableau shows the current state of the Simplex method. The variables $x_1$, $x_2$, $s_1$, $s_2$, and $s_3$ are represented as columns, and the objective function and constraints are represented as rows. The coefficients of the variables in each row represent the coefficients of the corresponding variable in the objective function or constraint. The right-hand side of each constraint is also shown.\n\nTo perform one iteration (pivot) of the Simplex method, we need to choose a variable to enter the basis (i.e., become a basic variable) and a variable to leave the basis (i.e., become a non-basic variable). In this case, we choose $x_2$ to enter the basis because it has a positive coefficient in the objective function. We choose $s_3$ to leave the basis because it is the variable with the smallest ratio of the right-hand side to the coefficient of $x_2$ in its row.\n\nTo perform the pivot operation, we divide the row corresponding to $s_3$ by the coefficient of $x_2$ in that row to make the coefficient of $x_2$ equal to 1. We then subtract multiples of this row from the other rows to make the other coefficients of $x_2$ equal to 0. Finally, we update the right-hand side of each row using the pivot row.\n\nThe resulting Simplex tableau shows the new state of the Simplex method, with $x_2$ and $s_3$ swapped as basic and non-basic variables. The new objective function value is 4, which is higher than the previous value of 2, indicating that we have made progress towards the optimal solution. We can continue to perform pivot operations until we reach the optimal solution, which is when all coefficients in the objective function row are non-negative."

I would like to avoid it, but I didn't find an option to generate this If I accidentally open it, Visual Studio crashes, intellisense get's slow some times, if ReSharper is turned on VS is slowed down enourmously, etc...\n\nI checked Simple.OData.Client and seems to have nice documentation and API. For instance: <https://github.com/object/Simple.OData.Client/wiki/Retrieving-data>\n\nFor Microsoft.OData.Client I didn't find documentation how to use it in a typed manner without generating the whole client. Is that possible? I only found this, where the generated context is used: <http://odata.github.io/odata.net/v6/#04-01-basic-crud-operations>\n\nI think going with Simple.OData.Client seems to be a better option, but I would prefer to use a Microsoft library.\nDo you have any reccomendations?",
        "answer": "I have just implemented integration from .Net Core Web App running in Azure App services to Dynamics 365 Web API as a POC.\nThis included reading reference data ( joining different entities ) and modifying entities with referential data columns.\n\nFull OData interface generation is problematic I found:\n\n* Could not find tooling that supports OAuth2 authorization and VS2019\n* Full interface definition inclusive of navigational properties / functions / actions and all entities with all fields becomes unwieldy to navigate and VS navigation is sluggish.\n* Depending on OData client you are going to use it will be sending much more information over the wire than needed and add complexity that is not in the spirit of the underlying REST OData service.\n* Generated code tools violated C# coding rules ( using reserved keywords like event, abstract and also generating members with same name as enclosing type ) requiring manual correction.\n\nAfter much research I started using [Simple.OData.Client](https://github.com/simple-odata-client/Simple.OData.Client/wiki) as this allowed me\n\n* VS2019 / .Net core compatible toolset / runtime\n* Connect to Dynamics 365 OData Web API with OAuth2 bearer token\n* Write typed code in VS\n* Create only the entity models / navigational properties etc that I needed\n* Can select only the entity attributes you need to return instead of 200 ( smaller payloads )\n\nYou have to create the entity classes used in the typed fluent API yourself\n\nUse DataContract attributes in case you want the CRM entity names to be different between CRM / C# code. \nSimple.OData will then use the DataContract attributes when making up the Http call.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't find the documentation all that insightful when I started looking deeper on issues like OAuth2 authorization and navigational properties but did find all my answers in secondary sources like github issues and some advanced tutorials for example\n<https://www.odata.org/blog/advanced-odata-tutorial-with-simple-odata-client/>\n\nAlso using Fiddler to see the communications going back and forth is unbelievably useful in understanding what is going on."

        "question": "If you write \"hello\" to a file in a JOS file system. Right after the write operation, the computer crashes. Is the content \"hello\" persisted (or written) on the disk?Yes, No,",
        "answer": "The answer is \"No\". Since the computer crashed right after the write operation, it means that the data was not properly flushed and synced to the disk. Therefore, the content \"hello\" was not persisted or written on the disk. In other words, the data was only present in memory or cache at the time of the crash and was not yet saved to the permanent storage device. As a result, any attempt to read the file after the crash would result in an empty file or an error."

        "answer": "If a CPU with a Current Privilege Level (CPL) of 3 attempts to access memory in a data segment with a Descriptor Privilege Level (DPL) of 0, JOS will trigger a General Protection Fault (GPF). To handle this exception, JOS will call the General Protection Fault handler, which is responsible for determining the cause of the fault and taking appropriate action, such as terminating the offending process or kernel thread. The GPF handler is a critical component of the operating system's memory protection mechanism, ensuring that privileged processes cannot access data or code segments with lower privilege levels."

I try calling it from a Java program with the following code.\n\n```\n    try\n    {\n        Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(c);\n\n        try\n        {\n            proc.waitFor();\n        }\n        catch(InterruptedException e)\n        {\n            System.out.println(\"Command failed\");\n        }\n    }\n    catch(IOException e)\n    {\n        System.out.println(\"Command failed\");\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n\n```\n\nThe program seems to be running fine, as it creates an xml file; however, the xml file is empty when I open it. I'm not encountering any exceptions in my Java program, so I'm baffled as to what the problem could be. Why would the command line program work fine normally, but then when called from Java not output anything to the file it created. I was thinking maybe it was some sort of permissions thing.

        "question": "Fast Trigonometry Calculations\n==============================\n\nYour task is to create a program which can calculate the sine, cosine and tangent of an angle in degrees.\n\nRules\n-----\n\n* No built-in trigonometry functions (not even secant, cosecant and cotangent if your language has them).\n* You may use lookup tables, but their total size must not exceed 3000 members (for all of the three operations put together). Please make it read the tables from a file (e.g. `trig.lookup`) so they don't confuse the code.\n* No network access.\n* You must correctly round your output as explained below. Don't use floor or ceiling.\n* You may use any method to calculate the values, for example [continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine#Continued_fraction), as long as it is correct to 7 significant figures.\n* Your code must be able to time itself. Exclude the file I/O operations from your time - so just time the function(s) that do(es) the trig and any rounding.\n* I must be able to run your code. Please post a link to a freely available compiler/interpreter and give the instructions needed to compile/run the code (e.g. what options to pass to GCC).\n* [Standard loopholes](http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/1061/standard-loopholes-which-are-no-longer-funny) apply.\n\nInput Format\n------------\n\n* Read from a file called `trig.in` unless your language doesn't support file I/O.\n* Angles are between 0 and 360 inclusive.\n* Input will consist of angles to ten significant figures in decimal digits, separated by new lines. For example:\n\n> \n> 90.00000000  \n> \n>  74.54390000  \n> \n>  175.5000000\n> \n> \n> \n\nOutput Format\n-------------\n\n* For each angle supplied, you must output its sine, cosine and tangent to 7 significant figures, separated by spaces, on a single line. Use \"scientific notation\", e.g. `1.745329E-5` for `tan 0.001` or `1.000000E+0` for `sin 90`.\n* Denote infinity or NaN by `n`, for example the output for `90.00000000` should be `1.000000 0.000000 n`.\n* If the input is three angles separated by newlines, your output should consist of three lines, each containing the sine, cosine and tangent.\n* You may not output anything else.\n* Output to a file called `trig.out` unless your language does not support file I/O.\n\nScoring\n-------\n\n* [fastest-code](/questions/tagged/fastest-code \"show questions tagged 'fastest-code'\"). The challenge is to write a program which computes these three values as quickly as possible. Fastest time wins.\n* Everyone will receive the same test input of many angles.\n* Times will be recorded on my machine.\n* Your score is the average of three runs on the same input (you can't save anything in between runs obviously).\n* Compiling time not included. This challenge is more about the method used than the language. (If someone could point me to how I would exclude compilation time for languages such as Java, I'd be very grateful)\n* My machine is an Ubuntu 14.04 install. The processor's stats are [on Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/dM1TW2S5) (obtained by running `cat /proc/cpuinfo`).\n* I will edit your time into your answer when I've tested it.",
        "answer": "Fortran 90\n==========\n\nI employ the [CORDIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordic) method with a pre-tabulated array of 60 arctan values (see Wiki article for details on why that's necessary).\n\nThis code requires a file, `trig.in`, with all the values on newlines to be stored in the same folder as the Fortran executable. Compiling this is,\n\n```\ngfortran -O3 -o file file.f90\n\n```\n\nwhere `file` is whatever filename you give it (probably `SinCosTan.f90` would be easiest, though it's not necessary to match program name and file name). If you have the Intel compiler, I'd recommend using\n\n```\nifort -O3 -xHost -o file file.f90\n\n```\n\nas the `-xHost` (which doesn't exist for gfortran) provides higher level optimizations available to your processor.\n\nMy test runs were giving me about 10 microseconds per calculation when testing 1000 random angles using gfortran 4.4 (4.7 or 4.8 is available in the Ubuntu repos) and around 9.5 microseconds using ifort 12.1. Testing only 10 random angles will result in an indeterminable time using Fortran routines, as the timing routine is accurate to the millisecond and simple math says it should take 0.100 milliseconds to run all 10 numbers.\n\n---\n\n**EDIT** Apparently I was timing IO which (a) made the timing longer than necessary and (b) is contrary to bullet #6. I've updated the code to reflect this. I've also discovered that using a `kind=8` integer with the intrinsic subroutine `system_clock` gives microsecond accuracy.\n\nWith this updated code, **I am now computing each set of values of the trigonometric functions in about 0.3 microseconds** (the significant digits in the end vary run-to-run, but it's consistently hovering near 0.31 us), a significant reduction from the previous iteration that timed IO.\n\n---\n\n```\nprogram SinCosTan\n   implicit none\n   integer, parameter :: real64 = selected_real_kind(15,307)\n   real(real64), parameter :: PI  = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028842\n   real(real64), parameter :: TAU = 6.2831853071795864769252867665590057684\n   real(real64), parameter :: half = 0.500000000000000000000_real64\n   real(real64), allocatable :: trigs(:,:), angles(:)\n   real(real64) :: time(2), times, b\n   character(len=12) :: tout\n   integer :: i,j,ierr,amax\n   integer(kind=8) :: cnt(2)\n\n   open(unit=10,file='trig.out',status='replace')\n   open(unit=12,file='CodeGolf/trig.in',status='old')\n!

        "question": "Consider an operation we will call scanRight1 that, given a function $f$$f$ of two arguments, and a sequence $a_1, \\ldots, a_N$$a_1, \\ldots, a_N$, computes a sequence $b_1, \\ldots, b_N$$b_1, \\ldots, b_N$ such that:  $b_N = a_N$$b_N = a_N$ $b_i = f(a_{i}, b_{i+1})$$b_i = f(a_{i}, b_{i+1})$, for $0 < i < N$$0 < i < N$ Define similarly scanLeft1 in a manner similar to scanRight1:  Given a function $f$$f$ of two arguments, and a sequence $a_1, \\ldots, a_N$$a_1, \\ldots, a_N$, scanLeft1 computes a sequence $b_1, \\ldots, b_N$$b_1, \\ldots, b_N$ such that:  $b_1 = a_1$$b_1 = a_1$ $b_i = f(b_{i-1}, a_{i})$$b_i = f(b_{i-1}, a_{i})$, for $0 < i \\leq N$$0 < i \\leq N$ Suppose that $f$$f$ is associative. is the result of scanRight1 same as the result of scanLeft1?",
        "answer": "The question asks whether the result of applying the scanRight1 operation to a sequence is the same as applying the scanLeft1 operation to the same sequence, given that the function f is associative. The answer is no. This is because the scanRight1 operation starts from the right end of the sequence and works backwards, combining each element with the result of the next element using the function f. The scanLeft1 operation, on the other hand, starts from the left end of the sequence and works forwards, combining each element with the result of the previous element using the same function f. \n\nWhile the function f being associative means that the order in which the elements are combined does not matter, the direction in which the operations are performed does matter. This is because the scanRight1 and scanLeft1 operations do not involve simply combining all the elements pairwise using f, but rather involve a sequence of pairwise operations that depend on the order of the elements. \n\nThe answer provides an example of a length two sequence A and a function f(x,y) = y for which the results of the scanRight1 and scanLeft1 operations are different. Specifically, the scanLeft1 operation produces a sequence with the same elements as the original sequence A, while the scanRight1 operation produces a sequence with the elements in the opposite order and with the second element replaced by the result of applying f to the two original elements. This shows that, even for an associative function f, the direction in which the operations are performed can affect the result of the scan operation."

Why?S4 voltage-sensing domain, like that of voltage-gated sodium channels, Intracellular polyamines block the ion channel pore, Calcium ions increase open probability, Magnesium ions cause a voltage-dependent block,",
        "answer": "The conductance of NMDA receptors activated by glutamate is strongly reduced at hyperpolarized potentials (more negative than ~-50 mV) under physiological conditions. The reason of this voltage-dependence is different than the voltage-gated sodium/potassium/calcium channels. The NMDA receptors aren't intrinsically voltage-sensitive, but they gain that attribute because of a magnesium block. Magnesium ions enter the NMDA receptor channel pore at negative potentials, interacting with pore-lining amino acid residues and blocking the NMDA receptors. The magnesium ions induce a fast flickering block, as they stochastically enter and leave the ion channel pore. When the cell depolarizes, the magnesium is repelled from the internal binding site by the electric field and the NMDA receptor can fully conduct."

Eventually this will culminate in a battle, where there is an actual siege of a palisade-type fortification, including siege weapons (we have done this successfully several times in the past).\n\nThis year we had the idea to include a dwarven party supporting the agressor: by supplying them with a **dwarven siege cannon**. What we're still struggling with, is how to make the cannon safe, and fun.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* It must be **safe** for our participants - for combatants *and* the crew manning the cannon.\n* The cannon should shoot real projectiles of some sort\n* The cannon will not shoot at people deliberately, but will instead be used against the walls/gate.\\*\n\t+ *Of course it must still be safe if one of the combatants were to be hit accidentally!*\n* A range of, say, 30-50 meters would be nice (could be somewhat ballistic).\n\n**Bonus:**\n\n* If at all possible the cannon should make a loud booming noise when fired\n* It would also look cool if there was a nice puff of smoke when fired.\n\nHow could we build a cannon which meets our above requirements?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA good answer would include:\n\n* Experience with cannons (or other \"gunpowder\" weapons) in LARP\n* What projectile is used\n* How it is propelled\n* How the cannon could be built\n* How special effects could be achieved (sound/smoke/...)\n\n---\n\n\\*) *The idea is that after X hits with the cannon the gate/some section of wall will \"collapse\", i.e. be opened manually.*",
        "answer": "What we normally use here in Russia is a cannon made from a metal tube (closed from one side) that shoots tennis balls. Fireworks are used to propel it -- and you have to experiment with the squibs available nearby to find those that are both safe and powerful enough. There is a special hole used to fire the squib. [Here is a video of me shooting it](https://vk.com/video256078547_456239046), from around 2:00 till 2:20.

        "answer": "Let the original price be denoted as 'P', which is equal to 100 cents (cp) or 80 shillings (s). \n\nGiven that the selling price is 140% of the original price, we can calculate the selling price as: \n\nselling price = P * (140/100) = 112 shillings\n\nTherefore, the discount given is the difference between the original price and the selling price: \n\ndiscount = P - selling price = 80 - 112 = -32 shillings\n\nHowever, since a discount cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the discount: \n\ndiscount = |-32| = 32 shillings\n\nTo express the discount as a percentage of the original price, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100: \n\ndiscount percentage = (32/80) * 100 = 40%\n\nTherefore, the formal answer is that a discount of 40% was given."

        "answer": "The bookshop initially had 10 hardback copies and 55 paperback copies. After selling 14 copies, there were 41 copies remaining. Let us denote the number of remaining paperback copies as 'p'. Thus, the number of remaining hardback copies is 41 - p. \n\nTo determine the number of paperback copies sold, we can use the fact that the bookshop sold a total of 14 copies. Therefore, the number of hardback copies sold is 14 - (41 - p) = p - 27. \n\nWe are given that the total revenue from selling these books was $460. We can set up an equation based on the prices of the hardback and paperback copies and the number sold: \n\n10(41 - p) + 20(p - 27) = 460 \n\nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n\n360 - 10p = 460 - 20p \n\nSolving for p, we get p = 36. \n\nTherefore, the number of paperback copies sold is 45 - 36 = 9."

It is evident that there is a direct proportionality between the number of machines and the number of bottles produced, as well as between the time taken and the number of bottles produced.

It's almost always the wrong choice that leads to difficult, messy code.\n\nIn this case it looks like you have three things that have an id and a temp, humidity and time property. This is exactly what objects are for.\n\nFor example you might represent the data like:\n\n```\nlet data = { machine_41: {temp: 40, humid: 10, time: 200},\n             machine_44: {temp: 30, humid: 15, time: 500},\n           } // etc\n\n```\n\nNow all your data is in one place and you can access it with simple properties:\n\n```\n data.machine_41.temp \n\n```\n\nTo go from your array of numbers to this object is simple with `reduce()`:\n\n```js\nvar activeMachines = [41,44,46]\r\n\nlet data = activeMachines.reduce((obj, machineID) => {\r\n    // some fake data\r\n    temp = 20       // or document.getElementById etc..\r\n    humidity = 10\r\n    time = 600\r\n    obj['machine_'+machineID] = {temp, humidity, time}\r\n    return obj\r\n}, {})\r\nconsole.log(\"machine_41 humidity:\",data.machine_41.humidity)\r\nconsole.log(data)\n```\n\nThis might not be the exact data structure you need (maybe it's better as an array for example), but this approach will serve you better than trying to create a bunch of individual variables."

        "question": "Is there any function objects in the boost that are generic equivalents to the std::equal\\_to, std::greater etc. family of function objects?\n\nEssentially, std::equal\\_to should become something like\n\n```\nstruct generic_equal_to\n{\n    template <class T, class U>\n    bool operator()(const T& t, const U& u) const\n    {\n        return t == u;\n    }\n};\n\n```\n\nI can see how the generic versions of std::plus etc. might be trickier due to issues with the return type (though the `decltype` can solve that). I can't see any possible reason why the std::equal\\_to function object itself should require a template argument, though.\n\nSurely somewhere in boost or in the STL these versions exist? They are, of course, trivial to write, but I very much dislike duplicating library code, especially for something as apparently trivial as this.\n\n**EDIT**:\n\nAs some context as to why I would want this instead of using lambdas, or another function-object generation method:\n\nI was writing a generic `boost::fusion` sequence comparison function thusly:\n\n```\ntemplate <class T>\nbool sequence_equal(const T& left, const T& right)\n{\n    return fusion::all(\n        fusion::zip(left, right),\n        fusion::fused<generic_equal_to>());\n}\n\n```\n\nNote the `fusion::fused<generic_equal_to>` part, which leads to the isse that you can't practically specify a `boost::lambda` or `boost::phoenix` function-object by type. I guess one solution might be decltype:\n\n```\nfusion::fused<decltype(_1 == _2)>()\n\n```\n\nThat seems very awkward though, and might not even work, depending on how `boost::lambda` or `boost::phoenix` is implemented - I'm really not sure.\n\nI know you can use `fusion::make_fused` to get around this whole issue, but then you have to instantiate the function object. The solution I thought of, then, would be a non-template `equal_to` struct - I called mine `generic_equal_to`.\n\nI know it's a very trivial problem - after all, `make_fused(_1 == _2)` will probably inline down to much the same assembly as `fused<generic_equal_to>`. I just couldn't believe that there was no `generic_equal_to` function object in boost or in the STL anywhere, hence this question.",
        "answer": "No, it definitely doesn't have to be in the same file, but it obviously has to \"know\" what the class is, i.e.: the header that has the class definition should be included in the file where the function is implemented. Your code should be fine, as commented.\n\n**after you added some context**\n\nYour `test` function is not in the `Files` namespace. If you want it to be in the global context, you should treat it as \"`::test`\" within the namespace, otherwise the compiler might expect the \"`Files::test`\" to be the friend function, and not the \"`::test`\" as in your case. Can't find the formal standard reference, but I'm pretty sure that's the case. Note that you're performing a forward declaration here, so there's no default fall-back to the upper level of scope for name resolution."

        "answer": "Ok , so I think that confusion lies in the concept of current. When we apply potential difference through a circuit having resistance, a single electron does not move from one end to the other. What actually happens is that it replaces electron next to it which in turn replaces the electron next to it and this happens till the last electron reaches the other terminal. The resistance from beginning itself shows its effect on the movement of charge and not when the charge passes through it. What u say is that a charge when passing through a resistance should lose energy and hence current shoould slow down is partially correct. Yes, resistance does slow down the movement of electron but that effect is observed in overall circuit and not just in the path where resistance is connected."

        "answer": "The statement \"Generative Adversarial Networks use the generator and discriminator models during training but only the discriminator for data synthesis\" is false. In fact, only the generator is used for data synthesis in GANs.\n\nDuring training, the generator and discriminator models are both used. The generator creates new data samples, while the discriminator evaluates whether the samples are real or fake. The two models are pitted against each other in a game-like manner, with the generator attempting to fool the discriminator and the discriminator attempting to correctly identify real data from the generated data. This process continues until both models reach a point of equilibrium where the generated data is indistinguishable from real data.\n\nHowever, during data synthesis, only the generator is used. The generator takes in a random noise vector and produces a new data sample that is similar to the real data it was trained on. This is the key feature of GANs \u2013 they can create new, unique data samples that are not present in the original dataset. The discriminator is not involved in this process, as its role during training was to evaluate the authenticity of data samples."

        "answer": "Per that link you provided to the Yii forums, there's an extension that handles this for you:\n<http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/dbreadwritesplitting>\n\nI'd probably look into that first, if you've got a lot of AR models.

For $n=1$, we have $a_1=1$ and $b_1=1$, so the identity holds. For $n=2,3,4$, we can also compute the values of $a_n$ and $b_n$ and see that they are equal, as listed in the solution.\nWhile checking the identity for small values of $n$ is not a proof, it gives us some confidence in conjecturing that the identity holds for all $n$. We prove this by induction.\nThe induction hypothesis is that $\\calP(n)=\\text{``}a_n=b_n\\text{''}$ is true. We must show that this implies $\\calP(n+1)$ is true, that is, $a_{n+1}=b_{n+1}$.\nWe start with the observation that $a_{n+1}=a_n+(n+1)^2$. Since we are assuming $a_n=b_n$, we can substitute $b_n$ in for $a_n$ to obtain \\[a_{n+1}=b_n+(n+1)^2.\\] Now we write out $b_{n+1}$ and try to show that it is equal to $b_n+(n+1)^2$:\n\\begin{align*} \nb_{n+1}&=\n\\frac{(n+1)(n+1+1)(2(n+1)+1)}{6}\\\\\n&=\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}\\,.\n\\end{align*}\nWe see that $b_{n+1}$ and $b_n+(n+1)^2$ have the same denominator, so we focus on the numerator:\n\\begin{align*}\n(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)&= (n+1)(2n^2+7n+6)\\\\\n&=2n^3+9n^2+13n+6n^2+28n+24\\\\\n&=2n^3+15n^2+41n+24\\\\\n&=(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3),\n\\end{align*}\nwhich is what we wanted to show. This completes the induction step, and thus we have proved that $a_n=b_n$ for all $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nFinally, we are asked to compute $\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=0}^{1000}(k+1)(3k+2)$. We use a change of variable $k' = k+1$ to get\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{k=0}^{1000}(k+1)(3k+2)\n&=\\sum_{k'=1}^{1001}k'(3k'-1)\\\\\n&=3 \\sum_{k'=1}^{1001}k'^{2}-\\sum_{k'=1}^{1001}k' \\\\\n&=3\\dfrac{1001\\cdot 1002\\cdot 2003}{6}-\\dfrac{1001\\cdot 1002}{2}\\\\\n&=\\dfrac{1001\\cdot 1002}{2}\\,(2003-1) \\\\\n&=1001^{2}\\cdot 1002 =1\\,004\\,005\\,002.\n\\end{align*}"

        "answer": "The main assumption made by Naive Bayes classifiers is that the features used for classification are independent of each other, which is why it is called \"Naive.\" In other words, it assumes that the presence of one feature does not affect the probability of the presence of another feature.\n\nTo build a pre-processor for compound words, there are two main approaches: the linguistic/human knowledge way and the statistical way. The linguistic approach would involve manually adding compound words to the lexicon. The statistical approach would involve extracting correlated pairs or tuples of words using measures such as mutual information or chi-square. This approach could be enhanced by filtering out candidates manually or using human knowledge to select which parts of speech tags to include in the correlation game (e.g. NN NN, NN of NN). Both approaches can be used in combination to improve accuracy."

        "answer": "The question asks about the subgradients of the Parametric ReLU function at $x=0$. Recall that a subgradient of a function at a point is a vector that lies below the function at that point and touches the function at that point. \n\nFor $x>0$, the function is simply $f(x) = x$, so the subgradient at $x=0$ is 0, since all values less than 0 are below the function. \n\nFor $x\\leq 0$, the function is $f(x) = ax$. The subgradient at $x=0$ is any value between $a$ and 0, since all values in this range lie below the function at $x=0$ and touch the function at $x=0$. \n\nHowever, for values of $a>1$, the function is strictly concave, meaning that any line segment connecting two points on the function lies below the function. This implies that there is no unique subgradient at $x=0$, since any vector below the function at that point can be a valid subgradient. Therefore, the answer is that none of the above statements is true. \n\nFor $a=1$, the function is not strictly concave, so there is a unique subgradient at $x=0$, which is any value between 1 and 0."

        "answer": "The correct answer can be simplified and explained as follows:\n\nLet's define the following variables:\n- A: number of reviews rated as positive by the first annotator\n- B: number of reviews rated as positive by the second annotator\n- AB: number of reviews rated as positive by both annotators\n- N: total number of reviews\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that:\n- A + (N - A) = N\n- B + (N - B) = N\n- AB = 80\n\nUsing these variables, we can calculate Cohen's Kappa as:\n\nKappa = (P(A,B) - P(e)) / (1 - P(e))\n\nwhere:\n- P(A,B) = (AB + (N - A - B + AB)) / N = (80 + N - A - B) / N\n- P(e) = (P(A) * P(B)) + (P(not A) * P(not B)) = [(A/N) * (B/N)] + [(1 - A/N) * (1 - B/N)]\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nKappa = (((80 + N - A - B) / N) - (((A/N) * (B/N)) + ((1 - A/N) * (1 - B/N)))) / (1 - (((A/N) * (B/N)) + ((1 - A/N) * (1 - B/N))))\n\nTo get the numerical value, we need to substitute N = 1000 (assuming there are 1000 reviews in total), and the given values for A and B. This gives:\n\nKappa = (((80 + 1000 - {a} - {b}) / 1000) - ((({a}/1000) * ({b}/1000)) + ((1 - {a}/1000) * (1 - {b}/1000)))) / (1 - ((({a}/1000) * ({b}/1000)) + ((1 - {a}/1000) * (1 - {b}/1000))))\n\nwhere {a} and {b} are the values given in the question.\n\nFinally, we can evaluate this expression and round to three decimal places to get the answer."

        "answer": "The content of the cell at row 8 column 1 (indexed as in the lectures) is ['S,X1', 'S, X1', 'S', 'S, X (with X => NP VP)']. This means that the cell contains a list of four different strings, each separated by commas. The first three strings are 'S,X1', 'S, X1', and 'S', respectively. These likely represent different types of sentence structures or grammatical categories. The final string, 'S, X (with X => NP VP)', indicates that the cell may also contain sentences with a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP). Overall, the answer provides a clear and concise description of the content of the specified cell."

The algorithm should have a time complexity of \u0398(n*log_n), where n is the size of the largest list.\n\nThe solution suggests improving the previous algorithm by reducing the number of calculations to be made. Instead of calculating all n1*n2 products, only the k*k largest products are needed, as the k largest products are among the products of the k largest elements of L1 with the k largest elements of L2. \n\nThe algorithm is presented in the form of a table with three sections: input, output, and the algorithmic steps. The input section specifies the two input lists, while the output section specifies the k largest products of pairs of elements from the two lists in descending order. \n\nThe algorithmic steps start by sorting the two lists in descending order. Then, an empty list L' is initialized. The algorithm then iterates over all pairs of elements (a,b) where a is in the first k elements of L1 and b is in the first k elements of L2. For each pair, a*b is appended to L'. \n\nAfter all pairs have been considered, L' is sorted in descending order, and the first k elements are selected as the output. The algorithm has a time complexity of \u0398(n*log_n), as the sorting step takes \u0398(k*log_k) and the nested loop takes \u0398(k^2). \n\nNote that the sorting step can be further optimized to run in linear time, but this was not required in the problem statement."

        "answer": "The question asks us to find a special vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ that can reproduce the label for each pattern.

The plot shows that the error decreases as $\\alpha$ increases, until it reaches a critical value $\\alpha_c=2$, where the error becomes zero. For $\\alpha>\\alpha_c$, the error becomes positive again, indicating that the solution becomes overfit to the training data. This means that there is a phase transition of the second order at $\\alpha_c$, where the solution changes from underfitting to overfitting."

        "answer": "The question is asking whether the result of applying the scanRight1 operation on a sequence is the same as applying the scanLeft1 operation on the reversed sequence, assuming that the function used in the operations is associative.\n\nThe answer is no, they are not always the same. This can be shown by using a counterexample where the function used is the identity function, and the sequence has at least two distinct elements. In this case, the result of scanRight1 would be a pair of the first and last elements of the sequence, while the result of scanLeft1 on the reversed sequence would be a pair of the last and first elements of the original sequence. Since the first and last elements are distinct, the two pairs would not be equal.\n\nMore generally, the answer can be explained by observing that the scanRight1 operation combines elements from right to left, while the scanLeft1 operation combines elements from left to right. Reversing the sequence changes the order in which the elements are combined, which can result in a different final result, even if the function used is associative."

The available computers have different disk transfer rates: computer A can transfer one word (4 bytes) every 5 microseconds, computer B has a disk transfer rate of 400 megabytes per second, and computer C has a disk transfer rate of 2 megabytes per second. The internet bandwidth is assumed to be much higher than the disk transfer rates.\n\nTo determine which computer can complete the download within 15 minutes, we need to calculate the time required to download the 800 megabyte file on each computer. \n\nFor computer A, we need to calculate the number of words in the file, which is 800 megabytes divided by 4 bytes per word, or 200 million words. Since computer A can transfer one word every 5 microseconds, it will take 5 microseconds times 200 million words, or 1000 seconds, to transfer the entire file. This is equivalent to 16.67 minutes, which is longer than the 15-minute time limit, so computer A cannot be used.\n\nFor computer B, we can calculate the time required to transfer the entire file by dividing the file size by the disk transfer rate, which is 800 megabytes divided by 400 megabytes per second, or 2 seconds. This is well within the 15-minute time limit, so computer B can be used.\n\nFor computer C, we can calculate the time required to transfer the entire file by dividing the file size by the disk transfer rate, which is 800 megabytes divided by 2 megabytes per second, or 400 seconds, which is equivalent to 6.67 minutes. This is also within the 15-minute time limit, so computer C can be used.\n\nTherefore, both computers B and C can be used to download the video lesson within the time limit, but computer A cannot."

For a simple example, let $D$ be the region obtained by removing from $\\Reals^{2}$ the negative horizontal axis and a closed disk of radius $r > 0$ about the origin, and let $f$ be the polar angle function.

Show that the optimal value of  the following linear program equals the number of edges crossed by a min $s,t$-cut: \\begin{align*} \\textbf{minimize} \\hspace{0.8cm} & \\sum_{e\\in E} y_e  \\\\ \\textbf{subject to}\\hspace{0.8cm} & y_{\\{u,v\\}}  \\geq x_u - x_v \\qquad \\mbox{for every $\\{u,v\\}\\in E$} \\\\ \\hspace{0.8cm} & y_{\\{u,v\\}}  \\geq x_v - x_u \\qquad \\mbox{for every $\\{u,v\\}\\in E$} \\\\ & \\hspace{0.6cm}x_s  = 0 \\\\ & \\hspace{0.6cm}x_t = 1 \\\\ & \\hspace{0.6cm}x_v \\in [0,1] \\qquad \\mbox{for every $v\\in V$} \\end{align*} The above linear program has a variable $x_v$ for every vertex $v\\in V$ and a variable $y_e$ for every edge $e\\in E$. \\emph{Hint: Show that the expected value of the following randomized rounding equals the value of the linear program. Select $\\theta$ uniformly at random from $[0,1]$ and output the cut $ S = \\{v\\in V: x_v \\leq \\theta\\}$.}",
        "answer": "The problem asks us to prove that the optimal value of the given linear program (LP) is equal to the number of edges crossed by a min $s,t$-cut in an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with source $s$ and sink $t$. The LP has variables $x_v$ for every vertex $v\\in V$ and $y_e$ for every edge $e\\in E$. The LP objective is to minimize the sum of $y_e$ over all edges $e\\in E$, subject to constraints that ensure that $x_s=0$, $x_t=1$, and $x_v\\in [0,1]$ for all $v\\in V$. The LP also has constraints for each edge $\\{u,v\\}\\in E$ that force $y_{\\{u,v\\}}$ to be at least $x_u-x_v$ and $x_v-x_u$. \n\nTo prove that the LP's optimal value is equal to the number of edges crossed by a min $s,t$-cut, we need to show two things: first, that the LP's optimal value is at most the number of edges crossed by a min $s,t$-cut, and second, that the LP's optimal value is at least the number of edges crossed by a min $s,t$-cut.\n\nTo prove the first part, we assume that $S$ is an optimal $s,t$-cut and construct a feasible solution to the LP that has value equal to the size of the cut. Specifically, we set $x_u=0$ for all $u\\in S$ and $x_v=1$ for all $v\\notin S$. We also set $y_e=1$ for all edges $e\\in \\delta(S)$ (i.e., all edges that cross the cut) and $y_e=0$ for all other edges. It is easy to verify that this solution satisfies all the LP's constraints and has value equal to the size of the cut. Therefore, the LP's optimal value is at most the number of edges crossed by a min $s,t$-cut.\n\nTo prove the second part, we assume that $(\\{x_v^*\\}_{v\\in V},\\{y_e^*\\}_{e\\in E})$ is an optimal solution to the LP and construct a randomized rounding algorithm that outputs a cut $S_\\theta=\\{v\\in V:x_v^*\\leq \\theta\\}$ for a random threshold $\\theta\\in [0,1]$. We then show that the expected value of the cut size $|\\delta(S_\\theta)|$ is at most the LP's optimal value. Specifically, we define a random variable $X_{e,\\theta}$ that indicates whether an edge $e$ is cut by $S_\\theta$, and compute the expected value of $\\sum_{e\\in E} X_{e,\\theta}$. We then show that for each edge $e=\\{u,v\\}\\in E$, the probability that $e$ is cut by $S_\\theta$ is equal to $|x_u^*-x_v^*|$, and that $\\sum_{e\\in E} |x_u^*-x_v^*|\\leq \\sum_{e\\in E} y_e^*$. This implies that the expected value of the cut size is at most the LP's optimal value, and hence that the LP's optimal value is at least the number of edges crossed by a min $s,t$-cut.\n\nTo summarize, we have proven that the optimal value of the given LP is equal to the number of edges crossed by a min $s,t$-cut in the graph $G$."

        "answer": "There's many ways to do it, one of which is to have a column in the table titled `new_notification` that will tell you if the notification is new(read by the user or not). So, for example, if a person likes another persons picture, in the table that column will have `new_notification` set to `Y`. When the user who's picture was liked logs into the website, you search for all rows where `new_notification = Y` do a count and show the number of notifications like facebook does. Once the user has seen the notifications or opened the notification bar, go through that table and set all the rows with `new_notification = Y` to `'N'`."

        "answer": "One use of `MPI_Barrier` is for example to control access to an external resource such as the filesystem, which is not accessed using MPI. For example, if you want each process to write stuff to a file in sequence, you could do it like this:\n\n```\nint rank, size;\nMPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);\nMPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);\nfor ( int ii = 0; ii < size; ++ii ) {\n    if ( rank == ii ) {\n        // my turn to write to the file\n        writeStuffToTheFile();\n    }\n    MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);\n}\n\n```\n\nThat way, you can be sure that no two processes are concurrently calling `writeStuffToTheFile`."

        "answer": "The computation reveals that there is an overlap of 120 square meters of wallpaper, which can be present in either two or three layers. Given that 36 square meters of the wallpaper has two layers, the remaining overlap in three layers is 120 - 34 = 86 square meters. Since 86 square meters of wallpaper creates two additional layers, it follows that the area over which it creates two extra layers is 43 square meters. Therefore, the answer is 43 square meters."

What does \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d spatial frequencies mean? Low spatial frequencies are associated with areas of relatively uniform signal intensity, whereas high spatial frequencies represent the detail within tissue. Noise in an image, due to its random spatial distribution from pixel to pixel, corresponds to high spatial frequencies. A low-pass filter therefore reduce the noise and improve the SNR of the image, but at the same time it degrades the spatial resolution."

The server code looks like this:\n\n```\nvar http = require('http');\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\nhttp.createServer(function(request, response) {\n    getFile(response);\n}).listen(8080);\n\nfunction getFile(response) {\n    var fileName = __dirname + \"/public/index.html\";\n    fs.readFile(fileName, function(err, contents) {\n        if (!err) {\n            response.end(contents);\n        } else {\n            response.end();\n            console.log(\"ERROR ERROR ERROR\");\n        }\n    });\n}\n\n```\n\nindex.html looks like this:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Static Page</title>\n    </head>\n    </body>\n        <h1>Returned static page</h1>\n        <p>This is the content returned from node as the default file</p>\n        <img src=\"./images/portablePhone.png\" />\n    </body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\nAs I would expect, I am getting the index.html page display without the image (because I am not handling the mime-type). This is fine; what is confusing me is, when I look at the network traffic, I would expect to have the index.html returned three times (the initial request, the image request and one for favicon.ico request). This should happen, because the only thing the web server should ever return is the index.html page in the current folder. I logged the \\_\\_dirname and fileName var and they came out correctly on each request and there were indeed three requests.\n\nSo my question is, what am I missing? Why am I not seeing three index.html response objects in the network monitor on Chrome? I know one of the students will ask and I'd like to have the right answer for him.",

Quite the contrary, this term goes to infinity very fast, the larger $b$ the faster.\n\nYou started with neglecting a smaller order term, that's all and well to get a rough idea, but that's certainly not rigorous, all the more inside an exponential. So let's factor out that $\\exp(b/x^2)$ growth rate and see what's left.\n\n$\\exp(\\frac{bm^2}{ (m^2+2x^2)x^2}) = \\exp(\\frac{b}{x^2})\\exp(\\frac{bm^2}{ (m^2+2x^2)x^2} - \\frac{b}{x^2})\n= \\exp(\\frac{b}{x^2})\\exp(\\frac{bm^2-b(m^2+2x^2)}{ (m^2+2x^2)x^2} )\n= \\exp(\\frac{b}{x^2})\\exp(\\frac{-2b}{m^2+2x^2}).\n$\n\nNow you can plug that in your sum and cancel out the $\\exp(\\frac{b}{x^2})$'s.

Consider my solution using String parsing:\n\n```\nvar bitParser = function (_nTestByte, _nBitOrdinal) {\n  var bits = (\"00000000\" + _nTestByte.toString(2)).slice(-8); // convert to binary and zero-pad\n  return bits[_nBitOrdinal] === \"1\";\n};\n\nconsole.log(bitParser(0b10100101, 2)); // ECMAScript 6+ prefix, returns true\n\n```\n\nIt works, and shows the desired result. However I have a hypothesis stating that a bit shifting technique would be a faster option than String manipulation. I tend to believe that but desire to prove it.\n\nThe problem is, I have yet to produce such a function that works correctly, let alone something I can test. I have created the following logic plan that I believe is accurate:\n\n```\n/*\n  LOGIC PLAN\n  ----------\n  0) Remember: all bitwise operators return 32 bits even though we are using 8\n  1) Left shift until the desired bit is the left-most (highest) position;\n  2) Right shift (zero filling) 31 bits to eliminate all right bits\n*/\n\n```\n\nThe implementation of the login plan follows. Because of the 32 bit nature of bitwise operators, its my belief that the entire left 3 bytes (24 bits) must be shifted off first before we even reach the byte being worked on. Then, assuming a scenario where the 3rd bit from the left (String ordinal 2) is the desired bit, I am shifting off 2 more bits (ordinals 0 & 1), for a total of 26 bits of left shifting.\n\nThis should produce a binary number with the desired bit all the way left followed by 31 undesired zero bytes. Right shifting those 31 bits away produces a binary with 31 (now) leading zero bits which evaluates to whatever the value of the desired bit is. But of course, I would not be writing this question if THAT were true, now would I? :-)\n\n```\n// hardcoded, assuming the second \"1\" (ordinal 2) is the bit to be examined\nconsole.log((0b10100101 << 26) >> 31); // instead of 1, returns -1\n\n```\n\nI feel like I am really close, but missing something or pushing JavaScript too hard (lol).",

You can either use that as-is, or force it to boolean via `!!flag` or `Boolean(flag)`:\n\nHere's your `bitParser` function using bitmasking:\n\n```js\nvar bitParser = function (_nTestByte, _nBitOrdinal) {\r\n  return !!(_nTestByte & Math.pow(2, _nBitOrdinal));\r\n};\r\nconsole.log(bitParser(0b10100101, 2)); // true\r\nconsole.log(bitParser(0b10100101, 1)); // false\n```\n\nRather than doing the `Math.pow` every time, of course, we'd probably be better off with a lookup table:\n\n```js\nvar bits = [\r\n  0b00000001,\r\n  0b00000010,\r\n  0b00000100,\r\n  0b00001000,\r\n  0b00010000,\r\n  0b00100000,\r\n  0b01000000,\r\n  0b10000000\r\n];\r\nvar bitParser = function (_nTestByte, _nBitOrdinal) {\r\n  return !!(_nTestByte & bits[_nBitOrdinal]);\r\n};\r\nconsole.log(bitParser(0b10100101, 2)); // true\r\nconsole.log(bitParser(0b10100101, 1)); // false\n```"

        "question": "In this week's lecture, you have been introduced to the aggregate method of ParSeq[A] (and other parallel data structures). It has the following signature:  def aggregate[B](z: B)(f: (B, A) => B, g: (B, B) => B): B Discuss, as a group, what aggregate does and what its arguments represent.  Implement aggregate using the task and/or parallel constructs seen in the first week and the Splitter[A] interface seen in this week's lecture. The Splitter interface is defined as:  trait Splitter[A] extends Iterator[A]:   def split: Seq[Splitter[A]]   def remaining: Int You can assume that the data structure you are defining aggregate for already implements a splitter method which returns an object of type Splitter[A].  Your implementation of aggregate should work in parallel when the number of remaining elements is above the constant THRESHOLD and sequentially below it.  Hint: Iterator, and thus Splitter, implements the foldLeft method.",
        "answer": "The given answer provides the implementation of the aggregate method using the task and parallel constructs seen in the first week and the Splitter[A] interface seen in the current week's lecture.\n\nThe first step is to define a constant THRESHOLD, which is used to determine whether to execute the aggregate operation sequentially or in parallel. The value of the threshold depends on the specific use case and should be chosen based on empirical testing.\n\nThe aggregate method takes two arguments: z, which is the initial value of the result, and two functions, f and g. The function f takes two arguments, a value of type B and a value of type A, and returns a value of type B. It is used to combine the current result with the next element of the data structure. The function g takes two values of type B and returns a value of type B. It is used to combine the results of two parallel computations.\n\nThe implementation of the aggregate method first defines a helper function go, which takes a Splitter[A] object as its argument. If the remaining number of elements in the Splitter is below the THRESHOLD, the method executes the foldLeft method on the Splitter, which applies the function f to each element and accumulates the result into a single value, starting with the initial value z. If the remaining number of elements is above the THRESHOLD, the method splits the Splitter into multiple Splitter objects, each containing a subset of the elements. The map function applies the go method to each Splitter object using the task construct, which creates a new computation that can be executed in parallel. The join function waits for the completion of each task and returns its result. Finally, the reduce function combines the results of all the parallel computations using the function g.\n\nThe implementation of aggregate is recursive, as it splits the data structure into smaller subsets until the remaining number of elements is below the THRESHOLD, at which point it executes the foldLeft method sequentially."

        "answer": "In x86, there are two possible ways to transfer arguments when invoking a system call, which are through the stack and through registers. \n\nWhen using the stack, the arguments are pushed onto the stack in reverse order before the system call instruction is executed. The system call then retrieves the arguments from the stack and uses them accordingly. This method is commonly used when there are more arguments than available registers.\n\nOn the other hand, when using registers, the arguments are stored in specific registers before the system call instruction is executed. The system call then reads the arguments directly from the registers. This method is commonly used when there are fewer arguments than available registers.\n\nIn the example given, the string and len arguments are likely being passed through the stack, as they are not explicitly being stored in registers beforehand. However, it is possible that some arguments may be passed through registers depending on the specific system call being used."

The problem is when I load the translation file in my application, I am getting segmentation faults whenever I click on any item of QMenuBar. \n\nI also have a context menu that is triggered with the contextMenuEvent of a GraphicsView in mainwindow. The program gives a segmentation fault when I try to execute the below line.\n\n```\nmContextMenu->exec(event->globalPos());\n\n```\n\nmContextMenu is a QMenu\\* and exec returns a QAction\\*.

I suspect you are using queries with `recursive` set to `1` or `2`. You should use [containable](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/core-libraries/behaviors/containable.html) at the very least.\n\nAlso look at the `explain` for your selects.

However, please do not hesitate to give more detailed answers that require prior knowledge - if these answer the question more accurately.*\n\nMy confusion currently comes from the fact that everything in the universe is moving in some way or another - so any reference point we use would also be moving/not completely reliable.\n\nAs such, how can we accurately determine that we have completed an exact 360 degree rotation around the sun (and as such, measure exactly how long it took)?\n\n*To be clear, this is asking about how we can determine that we have completed a single 360 orbit of our sun, and not the timing aspect of how we know how long a second is. If this situation is different for measuring the orbits of other bodies around their star - it would be great to expand on those differences as well.*",
        "answer": "When one asks the question, \"How is a year defined?\", there are actually a few different answers one can provide. What you're implicitly asking, even if you don't know, is how one defines a [Sidereal Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year). In effect, the Sidereal Year is the time necessary to complete one, full, 360 degree revolution around the Sun. This is opposed to the [Tropical Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year) (or else the Solar Year) which is the time necessary to travel just slightly less than a full 360 degrees (due to things like precession and the definition of the Tropical Year).\n\nSo your question boils down to, how is a Sidereal year determined? In practice, this is often done by choosing a specific starting point and noting where the Sun is with respect to the stars in the Sky. Then, it will be an entire sidereal year (and a 360 degree revolution) before the Sun returns to the same position as previously observed. Once you've observed the Sun in the *exact same position* you know a full revolution has occurred of the Earth around the Sun. It should be noted that the motion of the stars over a year is almost completely inconsequential. The stars are so immensely far away compared to their own motion, that their apparent motion (otherwise known as the proper motion) is basically nothing over a year. In this way, we consider the stars \"fixed\"."

        "answer": "Command line editing is not part of the requirements. Neither are you explicitly barred from using `readline()` which may be available on your system and performs just that.\n\nNote that your current implementation needs a lot more work to meet the actual requirements, so I suggest you focus on those instead of wasting time trying to re-implement a command line editor. Doing it properly is non trivial.\n\nNote also that your use of `scanf()` is inappropriate for reading an input line: `scanf(\"\\n%[^\\n]\", comando);` will indeed ignore any whitespace and read a command up to the next newline (excluded), but it will potentially write to memory beyond the end of the `commando` array, which causes undefined behavior. You should instead use `fgets()`, `readline()` or a custom written function to read the user's input. You would also detect end of file which may be useful :)"

Create `getMinimum` and `getMaximum` methods in a `PageAreaCollection` taking an `enum`.\n\n---\n\n**Justifications** (working backwards)\n\n*PageAreaCollection*\n\nStatic utility methods strike me as un-OO, particularly when there are other options.\n\nCreate a type, with type-appropriate methods: code shrinks, and reads better:\n\n```\nmin = PageAreaUtils.findMinimum(pageAreas, TOP); // Contrast with...\nmin = pageAreas.findMinimum(TOP);\n\n```\n\nShorter is good, but which reads nicer? Which is more communicative?\n\nWith static imports, you're still left with:\n\n```\nmin = findMinimum(pageAreas, TOP);    // Minimum pageAreas?!

This way or that, it's significantly cleaner, with an appropriately-named `Comparator`.\n\n```\nCollection<PageArea> pageAreas;\n\npublic double getMinimumPosition(MyRect.POSITION pos) {\n    double min = Double.MAX_VALUE;\n    for (PageArea area : pageAreas) {\n        min = Math.min(min, area.getBoundingBox().getPosition(pos));\n    }\n    return min;\n}\n\npublic double getMaximumPosition(MyRect.POSITION pos) {\n    double max = Double.MIN_VALUE;\n    for (PageArea area : pageAreas) {\n        max = Math.min(max, area.getBoundingBox().getPosition(pos));\n    }\n    return max;\n}\n\n```\n\nEssentially the same if `getPosition()` needs to be in the collection. My quibble with having the method in the bounding box is that it makes getting the position a bit bulky; I'd actually *prefer* this:\n\n```\narea.getBoundingBox(pos) // or area.getBoundingBoxPosition(pos)?\n\n```\n\n*Hungarian*\n\nEw. A method that's a dozen lines long doesn't need differentiation between parameters and locals; it's obvious. At *most* I could see naming member variables, but even that... Meh.\n\n*Interface naming*\n\nA `PageAreaInterface` is just a `PageArea`. An *implementation* may deserve a special name, but it'd be a \"special\" `PageArea` in that it implements specific functionality likely worth naming. It's the same reason we don't name things `IWhatever` anymore. The interface *is* the `Whatever`, implementations provide specificity and deserve naming."

        "question": "A lighthouse is placed close to a straight coastline at a position \u0007lpha along the shore and a \n          distance \beta out to the sea. The distance \beta is known, but the position \u0007lpha is not known.  \n          The lighthouse emits a series of short flashes at random intervals and hence in random directions \n          (uniformly at random over the full angle of 2\\pi). These pulses are intercepted on the coast by photo-detectors that \n          record only the fact that a flash has occurred, but not the angle from which it came. N flashes have been recorded so \n          far at positions x_k , k = 1, ... , N . \n          Goal: From the N observations x = \\{x_k\\}_{k=1}^N estimate the position of the lighthouse \u0007lpha. \n          Prove that the probability P(x_k|\u0007lpha,\beta) of observing a given value x_k conditioned to \u0007lpha, and \u0007beta is given \n          by the Cauchy distribution\n          P(x_k | \u0007lpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta}{\\pi[\beta^2 + (x_k - \u0007lpha)^2]}. \n          Hint: Recall that if one has a random variable A with probability distribution P(A) and one needs to express a probability \n          distribution of a random variable B = f(A), where f is some known function, one can use \\int P(A)\\delta [B-f(A)]dA, \n          where \\delta() is the Dirac delta function. The integral over B can then be computed by substitution f(A) \rightarrow D \n          and using the definition of a Dirac delta that states g(C) = \\int dD\\delta(C-D)g(D) for any test function g.",
        "answer": "The goal is to find the probability distribution function P(x_k|\u0007lpha,\beta) of observing a given value x_k conditioned on the position of the lighthouse \u0007lpha and the distance out to sea \beta. \n\nFirst, it is assumed that the flashes emitted by the lighthouse are uniformly distributed over the full angle of 2\\pi. Therefore, the probability distribution of the angle of a particular flash heta_k given \u0007lpha and \beta is P(heta_k|\u0007lpha, \beta) = (1 / \\pi).\n\nNext, the position x_k of the flash intercepted on the coast can be expressed as a function of the angle heta_k: x_k = \beta tan heta_k + \u0007lpha.\n\nUsing the hint provided, the probability distribution of x_k can be obtained by integrating the joint probability distribution of heta_k and x_k over all possible values of heta_k that give rise to a particular x_k. This can be expressed as:\n\nP(x_k|\u0007lpha, \beta ) = \\int P(heta_k|\u0007lpha, \beta) \\delta (x_k - [\beta tan heta_k + \u0007lpha]) d heta_k\n\nwhere \\delta() is the Dirac delta function.\n\nSubstituting D = \beta tan \theta_k + \u0007lpha and dD = \beta(tan^2 \theta_k + 1)d\theta_k = \beta ((\frac{D-\u0007lpha}{\beta})^2 + 1)d\theta_k, the integral can be rewritten as:\n\nP(x_k | \u0007lpha, \beta) = \\int \frac{\\delta(x_k - D)}{\\pi\\eta((\\frac{D-\u0007lpha}{\\eta})+ 1)}dD\n\nUsing the definition of the Dirac delta function, g(C) = \\int dD\\delta(C-D)g(D) for any test function g, the integral over D can be computed as:\n\nP(x_k | \u0007lpha, \beta) = \frac{1}{\\pi}\frac{1}{\\eta((\\frac{x_k-\u0007lpha}{\\eta})+ 1)} = \frac{\\eta}{\\pi [\beta^2 + (x_k - \u0007lpha)^2]}\n\nTherefore, the probability distribution function of observing a given value x_k conditioned on \u0007lpha and \beta is given by the Cauchy distribution, as stated in the question."

        "answer": "The given coefficient of isothermal compression of mercury, $\\kappa$, is assumed to be constant. We are asked to establish the expression for the differential of pressure, d$p$, at constant temperature in terms of $\\kappa$, density ($\\rho$), and d$\\rho$. \n\nWe start with the equation that gives the mass of mercury, $m = \\rho V = \\text{const}$, where $V$ is the volume of the mercury. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get $\\ln(\\rho V) = \\ln \\rho + \\ln V = \\text{const}$. Differentiating this equation with respect to some parameter $x$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(\\rho V) = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dx} + \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dV}{dx} = 0$$\n\nSolving for $dV/V$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{dV}{V} = -\\frac{\\rho}{V}\\frac{d\\rho}{dx}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression into the formula for the differential of pressure, we get:\n\n$$dp = -\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\frac{dV}{V} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\frac{\\rho}{V}\\frac{d\\rho}{dx}$$\n\nSince we are assuming constant temperature, the ideal gas law can be used to relate pressure, density, and temperature. However, since mercury is not an ideal gas, we cannot use the ideal gas law directly. Instead, we use the relation between density and volume, $\\rho = m/V$, and differentiate it with respect to $x$ to obtain:\n\n$$\\frac{d\\rho}{dx} = \\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dm}{dx} - \\frac{m}{V^2}\\frac{dV}{dx}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression into our equation for $dp$, we get:\n\n$$dp = \\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\frac{\\rho}{V}\\left(\\frac{1}{V}\\frac{dm}{dx} - \\frac{m}{V^2}\\frac{dV}{dx}\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$dp = \\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\left(\\frac{dm}{Vdx}\\frac{1}{\\rho} - \\frac{dp}{\\rho}\\right)$$\n\nSince $m/V = \\rho$ and $dp/dx = 0$ (since we are assuming constant temperature), we can simplify further to obtain the final expression:\n\n$$dp = \\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}$$\n\nwhich is equivalent to the earlier equation obtained from the logarithmic differentiation."

        "answer": "The question asks for the number of clusters containing most of the configurations in the random-subcube model, and the complexity of these clusters as a function of $\\alpha$. To answer this question, we first need to compute the total entropy of the model, which can be done using Laplace's method. \n\nThe total entropy of the model is given by:\n$$\n\\sum_A 2^{Ns(A)} \\approx N \\int ds 2^{N(\\Sigma(s)+s)} [\\Sigma(s) \\geq 0] \\approx 2^{N(\\Sigma(s^*)+s^*)}\n$$\nwhere $s^*$ is the value of $s$ that minimizes $\\Sigma(s)+s$ subject to the constraint $\\Sigma(s) \\geq 0$. Note that the sum over $A$ counts each configuration multiple times if it belongs to multiple clusters, but in the regime $\\alpha > \\alpha_d$ we have shown that the fraction of solutions belonging to more than one cluster is exponentially small, so this overcounting is negligible. \n\nTo find the value of $s^*$, we need to solve the minimization problem:\n$$\n\\min_s \\{\\Sigma(s)+s \\mid \\Sigma(s) \\geq 0\\}\n$$\nTaking the derivative of $\\Sigma(s)+s$ with respect to $s$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma}{\\partial s} = -1\n$$\nSolving for $s$ gives:\n$$\ns^0 = 2 \\frac{1-p}{2-p}\n$$\nIf $\\Sigma(s^0)+s^0 \\geq 0$, then $s^0$ is the value of $s$ that minimizes $\\Sigma(s)+s$ subject to the constraint $\\Sigma(s) \\geq 0$.

The number of clusters containing most of the configurations is then given by the value of $s$ that maximizes $\\Sigma(s,\\alpha)$, subject to the constraint $\\Sigma(s) \\geq 0$. We can plot this complexity as a function of $\\alpha$ and discuss its behavior."

For example, the letter I appears 4 times and can be represented by the code 111, while the letter E appears only once and can be represented by the code 00000. After applying the algorithm to all the letters, it is found that a total of 111 bits are needed to represent the sequence.\n\nTo calculate how many bits per letter are necessary on average, we divide the total number of bits (111) by the total number of letters (32, obtained by counting the letters in the original sequence). This gives us an average of 3.468975 bits per letter. This means that on average, each letter in the sequence can be represented using approximately 3.47 bits."

        "answer": "Let x be the initial quantity of gasoline purchased by the driver, y be the new quantity to be purchased, and p be the original price per liter. Based on the given equation, where (1.25 * p) y = 1.2 (p * x), it can be determined that the reduction in the amount of gasoline to be purchased is equal to (1.2 / 1.25) x, which simplifies to 0.96 x. Therefore, the reduction in the amount of gasoline to be purchased is equivalent to a 4% decrease."

        "answer": "The solution to the problem involves the calculation of the time taken by a car to cover a distance of 50 meters when it accelerates from rest at a rate of 20 meters per second squared and then moves at a constant speed of 60 km/hr before decelerating at the same rate to come to a stop. \n\nThe initial speed of the car is zero, and the acceleration is 20 meters per second squared. Therefore, the time taken to reach a speed of 60 km/hr (or 16.67 m/s) can be calculated using the equation: \n\nv = u + at \n\nwhere v is the final speed, u is the initial speed, a is the acceleration, and t is the time taken. \n\nThus, t = (v - u) / a = (16.67 - 0) / 20 = 0.8333 seconds \n\nThe distance covered during this acceleration phase can be calculated using the equation: \n\ns = ut + 0.5at^2 \n\nwhere s is the distance covered. \n\nThus, s = 0 + 0.5 * 20 * (0.8333)^2 = 6.944 meters \n\nThe distance covered during the constant speed phase is simply: \n\ns = vt = 16.67 * (50 - 6.944) = 694.4 meters \n\nFinally, the time taken to decelerate from 60 km/hr to rest can be calculated using the same formula as before: \n\nt = (v - u) / a = (0 - 16.67) / -20 = 0.8333 seconds \n\nThe distance covered during this phase is: \n\ns = ut + 0.5at^2 = 0 + 0.5 * (-20) * (0.8333)^2 = 6.944 meters \n\nTherefore, the total distance covered by the car is 694.4 + 6.944 + 6.944 = 708.288 meters. \n\nThe average speed of the car for the entire journey is: \n\naverage speed = total distance / total time = 708.288 / (0.8333 + 50 + 0.8333) = 13.15 m/s \n\nHence, the time taken by the car to cover a distance of 50 meters is: \n\ntime taken = distance / speed = 50 / 13.15 = 3.803 seconds (to three decimal places)."

        "answer": "The best way to encode the feature \"span\" for logistic regression is to group the values into appropriate bins and then use one-hot encoding. This means dividing the range of values into smaller intervals or bins and then assigning a binary variable (0 or 1) for each bin. This approach is useful because it transforms a continuous variable into a categorical one, which is more suitable for logistic regression models. It also allows for non-linear relationships between the feature and the target variable to be captured. Therefore, by using one-hot encoding, we can effectively represent the \"span\" feature in a logistic regression model."

To do so, we start with the Van der Waals equation and manipulate it to express the quantity $\frac{pV}{RT}$ in terms of powers of $p$ or $\frac{1}{V}$. We end up with an approximation that is valid for small values of $p$ or large values of $V$. \n\nSpecifically, we obtain the following approximation: \n\n$$\n\\frac{pV}{nRT} \\approx 1 + \\frac{nb}{V} - \\frac{na}{VRT} \\approx 1+\\frac{n}{V} \\left( b - \\frac{a}{RT} \\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are constants that depend on the gas.

        "question": "You have been hired to evaluate an email monitoring system aimed at detecting potential security issues. The targeted goal of the application is to decide whether a given email should be further reviewed or not. You have been given the results of three different systems that have been evaluated on the same panel of 157 different emails. Here are the classification errors and their standard deviations: system 1 (error=0.079, stddev=0.026) system 2 (error=0.081, stddev=0.005) system 3 (error=0.118, stddev=0.004) What should be the minimal size of a test set to ensure, at a 95% confidence level, that a system has an error 0.02 lower (absolute difference) than system 3? Justify your answer.",
        "answer": "The question asks for the minimum size of a test set needed to ensure, with 95% confidence, that a new email monitoring system has an error that is 0.02 lower (absolute difference) than System 3, based on the results of three different systems evaluated on a panel of 157 emails. Two approaches are considered: binomial confidence interval and t-test.\n\nFor the binomial confidence interval approach, the evaluation of a binary classifier follows a binomial law with parameters (perror, T), where T is the test set size. Using normal approximation of the binomial law, the width of the confidence interval around the estimated error probability is q(\u03b1)*sqrt(pb*(1-pb)/T), where q(\u03b1) is the 1-\u03b1 quantile (for a 1 - \u03b1 confidence level) and pb is the estimation of perror. Here, the confidence interval width is set to 0.02, and pb is set to 0.118, with q(0.05) = 1.96 from normal distribution quantile charts. Solving for T gives a result of approximately 1000.\n\nFor the t-test approach, the new system's relative behavior on each of the test cases is considered, with each test estimation subset of size 1. If the new system has an error of 0.098 (= 0.118 - 0.02), it can vary from System 3 between 0.02 and 0.216 of the test cases. The mean (\u03bc) of the t-test is between 0.02 and 0.216, and the standard deviation (s) is assumed to be the same as the other systems at 0.004. Thus, t is between 5*sqrt(T) and 54*sqrt(T), which is already bigger than 1.645 for any T bigger than 1. This approach doesn't offer much insight, but it does suggest that a minimum of 5 test cases are needed if there is a 0.216 difference between the systems.\n\nOverall, the answer suggests that if we want to have a (lowest possible) difference of 0.02, we should have at least 1/0.02 = 50 test cases. However, these numbers are low because the assumptions made about the test setup are strong, namely, that it is a paired evaluation. In such a case, having a difference that is 5 times bigger than the standard deviation is always statistically significant at a 95% level."

        "answer": "To solve this problem, we can use the formula: sell price = cost + profit. Given that the profit on one item is $20 and represents 10% of the cost, we can calculate the cost of each item to be $400. Thus, the sell price is $440 for each item. Selling all 100 items would give the retailer a profit of $2,000. \n\nIf the retailer offers a 5% discount on the sell price, then the new sell price becomes $418. This results in a profit of $18 per item sold. To earn a profit of $2,000, the retailer must sell 223 items. Selling 221 items would result in a profit of $1,989, which is not enough. Therefore, the final answer is 223 items."

        "answer": "The correct statement is that Ridge regression can be useful to reduce overfitting. This is because Ridge regression adds a regularization term to the mean-squared error, which penalizes large values of the model weights. This helps to prevent the model from overemphasizing certain features that may only be relevant to the training set and not generalize well to the test set. \n\nOn the other hand, feature augmentation, cross-validation, and discarding some training samples are not likely to improve the performance of this specific model. Feature augmentation may increase overfitting, as it can introduce more noise and complexity to the model. Cross-validation can help to select a better model, but it does not directly improve the performance of a specific model. Discarding training samples may reduce the amount of data available for training, which can increase overfitting."

Think of [remora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remora) cleaning sharks in order to feed themselves and avoid predators, or (again already mentioned in comments) mitochondria in animal cells.\n\nFrom a worldbuilding perspective, the key elements are that both organisms derive a net benefit from the relationship, and exist in such a way that they can interact to produce those benefits (like living physically close enough to interact, as in the remora, or even becoming incorporated into the same larger organism, as in the mitochondria).

        "answer": "The answer to the question is that the minimum size of page table pages required to map a single page of physical memory in a 32-bit architecture with a four-level page table and a page size of 4KB is 16KB. This means that the page table needs to have at least 4 pages, each of 4KB in size, to map a single page of 4KB in physical memory. \n\nIn a four-level page table, each page table page is used to store the table entries for the next level of the page table hierarchy. The first level of the page table is the page directory, which contains pointers to the second level page tables. The second level page tables contain pointers to the third level page tables, and so on until the fourth level page tables, which contain the actual page table entries that map virtual addresses to physical addresses.\n\nSince each page table page is 4KB in size, and there are 4 levels in the page table hierarchy, the minimum size of page table pages required to map a single page of physical memory is 4 pages x 4KB per page = 16KB. This means that even for a single page of physical memory, the page table can be quite large, which highlights the importance of efficient page table management techniques in modern operating systems."

The fifth instruction stores the updated value of x2 back into memory. The sixth instruction increments the memory address in x1. Finally, the loop is initiated with a modulo scheduling directive.\n\nThe shortest achievable initiation interval (II) is 2.

If the number of dp varies, the value to be added (0.005 in the example) varies. You could create a table to hold the number of decimal places in one column and the rounding value to add in the other. Alternatively, you could use an expression with powers of 10, etc.\n2.

        "answer": "The question asks the reader to decode a message encrypted using the PGP hybrid cryptography system. The system uses a One-Time Pad decimal encryption method to encrypt blocks of 6 digits of a sequence of numbers, and RSA to encrypt the secret key used for encryption. The reader is given the public and private keys for RSA, and the encrypted message to decode.\n\nTo decode the message, the reader needs to calculate M = C^(d) mod n, where C is the encrypted message, d is the private key for RSA, and n is the public key for RSA. In this case, the calculation is 58'423^(16'381) mod 172'831. The difficulty lies in the fact that 16'381 needs to be decomposed into the powers of 2, except 2^(1), and the squares of 58'423 modulo 172'831 need to be calculated iteratively.\n\nAfter calculating the squares, the product of all squares except 58'423^(2) needs to be calculated to find the secret key used for encryption, which turns out to be 142'857. To decode the message, the secret key needs to be subtracted from each block of the encrypted message modulo 10, and the resulting sequence of numbers needs to be translated into letters using the given convention.\n\nThe decoded message is \"CET_EXERCICE_VAUT_DIX_POINTS\", which means \"This exercise is worth ten points\" in English."

        "answer": "The problem presented in the question is about finding the optimal procedure to determine which glass out of a row of 100 to 200 glasses is poisoned, using the smallest number of tests possible. The author of the problem suggests choosing a glass at random and testing it first, while the commissaire argues that this would be a waste of money. However, it turns out that the optimal procedure is not what either of them suggests.\n\nThe optimal procedure involves using a coding algorithm called Huffman coding, which constructs a decision tree that minimizes the expected number of tests needed to determine which glass is poisoned. This tree is not necessarily balanced, and the testing of the glass chosen at random by the author may not be the best first step.\n\nThe number of tests needed by the optimal procedure depends on the number of glasses in the row, which is denoted by N. In general, the number of tests needed is equal to the floor of the logarithm base 2 of N plus 2/N. This formula takes into account the fact that there is a chance the poisoned glass will be in the last group of two glasses, which requires an extra test.\n\nComparing this result to the number of tests needed by the author's procedure, it turns out that the author's procedure is only optimal in the rare case where the chosen glass happens to be the poisoned one. In all other cases, it requires one more test than the optimal procedure. On average, the author's procedure requires log2(N) + (N - floor(log2(N)))/N tests, while the optimal procedure requires floor(log2(N)) + 2/N tests. For example, for 129 glasses, the author's procedure leads to an average of 7.95 tests, while the optimal procedure leads to an average of 7.02 tests.\n\nOverall, it is important to use a systematic and mathematically sound approach to solve problems like this, rather than relying on intuition or guesswork. The optimal solution may not always be obvious, but it can be found through careful analysis and logical reasoning."

When 41 is subtracted from 10^29, the resulting number is a 29-digit number with 27 nines and 59 at the end. The sum of the digits in this number can be calculated as 27 times 9 plus 5 plus 9, which equals 257. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 257."

This means that 1.5% of the words are guaranteed to be wrongly tagged. \n\nFor the remaining words (100%-1.5%), the tagger's performance is assumed to be 98% on known words. This means that 98% of these words are correctly tagged.\n\nTo calculate the overall performance of the tagger, we need to take into account both the known and unknown words.

        "question": "We learnt in the lecture that terms are typically stored in an inverted list. Now, in the inverted list, instead of only storing document identifiers of the documents in which the term appears, assume we also store an *offset* of the appearance of a term in a document. An $offset$ of a term $l_k$ given a document is defined as the number of words between the start of the document and $l_k$. Thus our inverted list is now:  $l_k= \\langle f_k: \\{d_{i_1} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]\\},  \\{d_{i_2} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_2}}]\\}, \\ldots,  \\{d_{i_k} \\rightarrow [o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_k}}]\\} \\rangle$  This means that in document $d_{i_1}$ term $l_k$ appears $n_{i_1}$ times and at offset $[o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]$, where $[o_1,\\ldots,o_{n_{i_1}}]$ are sorted in ascending order, these type of indices are also known as term-offset indices. An example of a term-offset index is as follows:  **Obama** = $\u27e84 : {1 \u2192 [3]},{2 \u2192 [6]},{3 \u2192 [2,17]},{4 \u2192 [1]}\u27e9$  **Governor** = $\u27e82 : {4 \u2192 [3]}, {7 \u2192 [14]}\u27e9$  **Election** = $\u27e84 : {1 \u2192 [1]},{2 \u2192 [1,21]},{3 \u2192 [3]},{5 \u2192 [16,22,51]}\u27e9$  Which is to say that the term **Governor** appear in 2 documents. In document 4 at offset 3, in document 7 at offset 14. Now let us consider the *SLOP/x* operator in text retrieval. This operator has the syntax: *QueryTerm1 SLOP/x QueryTerm2* finds occurrences of *QueryTerm1* within $x$ (but not necessarily in that order) words of *QueryTerm2*, where $x$ is a positive integer argument ($x \\geq 1$). Thus $x = 1$ demands that *QueryTerm1* be adjacent to *QueryTerm2*.  Consider the general procedure for \"merging\" two term-offset inverted lists for a given document, to determine where the document satisfies a *SLOP/x* clause (since in general there will be many offsets at which each term occurs in a document). Let $L$ denote the total number of occurrences of the two terms in the document. Assume we have a pointer to the list of occurrences of each term and can move the pointer along this list. As we do so we check whether we have a hit for $SLOP/x$ (i.e. the $SLOP/x$ clause is satisfied). Each move of either pointer counts as a step. Based on this assumption is there a general \"merging\" procedure to determine whether the document satisfies a $SLOP/x$ clause, for which the following is true? Justify your answer.      1. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in $L$ regardless of $x$, and we can ensure that each pointer moves only to the right (i.e. forward).     2. The merge can be accomplished in a number of steps linear in $L$, but a pointer may be forced to move to the left (i.e. backwards).     3. The merge can require $x \\times L$ steps in some cases.,",

We get a sequence of items one by one each having a size of at most $1$, and are required to place them into bins as we receive them. Our goal is to minimize the number of bins we use, subject to the constraint that no bin should be filled to more than its capacity.  An example is as follows: \\begin{center} \\vspace{4mm} \\includegraphics[width=9cm]{binpackingExample2} \\end{center} Here, seven items have already arrived that we have packed in three bins. The newly arriving item of size $1/6$ can either be packed in the first bin, third bin, or in a new (previously unused) bin. It cannot be packed in the second bin since $1/3 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6 > 1$. If it is packed in the first or third bin, then we still use three bins, whereas if we pack it in a new bin, then we use four bins. In this problem you should, assuming that all items have size at most $0 <\\epsilon\\leq 1$, design and analyze an online algorithm for the online bin-packing problem that uses at most \\begin{align} \\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon} \\mbox{OPT} + 1 \\mbox{ bins,} \\label{eq:binguarantee} \\end{align} where $\\mbox{OPT}$ denotes the minimum number of bins an optimal packing uses.

        "answer": "The given problem is an online bin-packing problem where we need to pack a sequence of items, each having a size of at most $1$, into bins of capacity $1$ such that the number of bins used is minimized. We need to design an online algorithm and analyze it to prove that it satisfies the guarantee $\\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon} \\mbox{OPT} + 1$ for the minimum number of bins used by an optimal packing.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is a greedy algorithm that packs an arriving item of size $s$ as follows:\n\n- If it fits, pack the item in an already used bin.\n- Otherwise, pack the item in a new bin.\n\nTo prove that the algorithm satisfies the guarantee, we need to show that at any point of time, all but $1$ bin have load at least $1-\\epsilon$. This is because if the algorithm has opened $m+1$ bins, then the total size of all items packed so far is at least $(1-\\epsilon)m$, and $\\opt$ needs at least $(1-\\epsilon)m$ bins to pack these items.\n\nTo prove the above claim, we make use of the following observation:\n\nClaim: Whenever a new bin is opened, every other bin is packed with items of total size at least $1-\\epsilon$.\n\nProof: We only open up a new bin if the arriving item of size $s \\leq \\epsilon$ does not fit in an already used bin. Since it does not fit in an already used bin, it implies that every such bin is packed with items of total size at least $1-\\epsilon$.\n\nHence, the claim follows.\n\nThus, at any point of time, all but $1$ bin have load at least $1-\\epsilon$, and the algorithm uses at most $\\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon} \\mbox{OPT} + 1$ bins, as required."

        "answer": "I really enjoyed reading Winskel when I was taking the undergrad course on semantics. I can't tell if it's dated, though, since I don't do research in this field. A plus of Winskel is that you can find it translated in other languages than English. \n\nFor a further reading, more at a graduate level, I'd suggest John Mitchell's [books](http://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/books.html) *Foundations for Programming Languages* and *Concepts in Programming Languages*. If you read only the first chapters, I guess they also meet your requirement of conciseness.\n\nYou will not find free drafts of these books, so if you have a restricted budget go for the \"might\" in Radu's answer."

Firstly, in human cells, DNA is compartmentalized within the nucleus, while bacterial DNA is found in the cytoplasm. Therefore, eukaryotic mRNA must be exported from the nucleus before its product can be made. Secondly, many bacterial mRNAs (but not all) are polycistronic, meaning they can code for multiple proteins, while eukaryotic mRNAs are processed to only code for one protein. Thirdly, bacterial mRNA is colinear with DNA (no introns), while eukaryotic pre-mRNA contains introns that are removed by splicing. Fourthly, bacterial mRNA lacks a poly-A tail or a 5' cap/coiffe. Finally, many bacterial genes are organized into operons, where the products have a function that is involved in the same process (e.g. amino acid synthesis), which is not the case for eukaryotic genes."

If you want a 10 right now, just walk out of my office right now, don't speak to me again and I'll give it to you!*\n\nAnd then, before I even had a chance to say anything at all, he crossed out my 8.2 and wrote a gigantic 10 where the 8.2 was before. When I had a chance to say my piece, all I did was apologize and try to emphasize as much I possibly could that I meant no disrespect at all, I was just trying to gauge how rigorous of a standard I should expect so that any mistake I made in the past wouldn't be repeated.\n\nAfter a while of my apologies, he said:\n\n*\"Alright, forget about it, let's just start over and pretend it never happened\"*\n\nA while after that, I was still pretty anxious, so he gave me some time to calm down and my grade went from 8.2 to 9.6. I guess what I'm looking for in an answer is advice on what I could have done better so that I don't mess up like this in the future.\n\n> \n> **Some helpful background but not absolutely necessary**: A colleague of mine had an initial grade of 9.3, after the review, it was 9.9. The reason was that in his answer to a problem asking for a proof of a certain statement, he actually stated and proved a much more general result and said the initial statement was just a particular consequence of that result - the professor didn't like that and thought a 10 was undeserved. Another colleague mentioned a story of grades going up so far as 9.5 after the review (with an initial grade of 1.5) in another exam of some other course he gave on the past. Yet another colleague shared that his initial grade was 3.8, but he managed to convince the professor that a lot of his other arguments were right too - his grade would then go up to something between 5.5 (the bare minimum for a C is 5) and 7, and in order to avoid that the professor took points of another unrelated answer which had initially been awarded a full mark, said \"alright, you got a 5, it's good enough\" and left it at that (my colleague was the first one after me in the office and heard what had happened before because the door to his office was open, so that's why I think he didn't argue anymore). Finally, I and another colleague whose grade went from 8.3 to 9.3 agreed that a general impression of his correction was that he just read your proof once and if he didn't agree that was it (where it also happened to him that he proved more general results than asked and the professor didn't like it or hadn't read the arguments carefully).

Ask yourself does it make sense that any one except the Employer can change who his employees are? to me that's in the words you've chosen already. The Employer employs the Employee and should have full control over who his/hers employees are.

If the images for example are stored on the SDCard and that is not present, the URI will return no photo about it. For this you need to do further checks.\n\nThis will help you also (if Uri fails it sets a default placeholder image):\n\nand calling that function (contactimage is an ImageView):\n\n```\nUri contactphoto = objContact.getPhotoUri();\ncontactimage.setImageURI(contactphoto);\ntry {\n    String nullString = contactimage.getDrawable().toString();\n} catch (java.lang.NullPointerException ex) {\n    contactimage.setImageResource(R.drawable.contactplaceholder);\n}\n\n```"

        "answer": "I would strongly recommend the [Entityform](https://www.drupal.org/project/entityform) module. Going with this module, would allow you to take advantage of the countless contributed modules that add fields via [field ui](http://drupalwatchdog.com/volume-1/issue-1/introduction-field-ui). Like the most useful for you would be the [Rules](https://www.drupal.org/project/rules) and [Views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views) modules.\n\nRules would be used to create custom conditional actions when your form is submitted and Views would allow you to create custom displays using form submissions."

        "answer": "It's generally considered a best practice not to change inputs, although there is nothing preventing your from doing so - those arguments are treated just like variables inside the procedure. For short, simple functions you can get away with it. But if you have a longer, more complex function and you stick to never changing inputs, your code becomes much easier to maintain.\n\nSay you get a date from the user, but you want to go back to the last statement date which is always the last day of the previous month. You can manipulate the argument like\n\n```\nPublic Function LastStatementAmount(ByVal inputDate As Date) As Double\n\n    Dim Return_ As Double\n\n    inputDate = DateSerial(Year(inputDate), Month(inputDate), 0)\n\n    'do calculations here\n\n    LastStatementAmount = Return_\n\nEnd Function\n\n```\n\nand that works. But the better way is to change the variable name to reflect what changes you made to the value\n\n```\nPublic Function LastStatementAmount(ByVal inputDate As Date) As Double\n\n    Dim Return_ As Double\n    Dim stmtDate As Date\n\n    stmtDate = DateSerial(Year(inputDate), Month(inputDate), 0)\n\n    'do calculations here\n\n    LastStatementAmount = Return_\n\nEnd Function\n\n```\n\nIf this were a larger function, it would be better to see `stmtDate` and know that you had already modified the input date.\n\nAnother reason not to change an input parameter, as mentioned in the comments, is that if you don't specify a passing mechanism, the parameter is, by default, ByRef and if the calling procedure is expecting that the value didn't change, you might break the code. You should always specify ByVal or ByRef so it's clear what your code intends."

        "answer": "The problem requires us to determine the number of ways to select any two stations from a total of 30 stations, taking into consideration the direction of travel (i.e., the route from Hyderabad to Bangalore is distinct from the route from Bangalore to Hyderabad). This can be calculated using the permutation formula for selecting two objects from a set of 30, with an additional factor of 2 to account for the two possible directions of travel. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose two stations with direction of travel considered is 30P2 * 2 = 870. Hence, the final answer is 870."

Assume for instance that $y\\_2>1/n$. Define a deformation $(y\\_1(z),y\\_2(z))$ of $(y\\_1,y\\_2)$ for every small enough nonnegative $z$ by $y\\_1(z)=y\\_1+z$ and\n$$\r\n\\frac1{1+ny\\_1(z)}+\\frac1{1+ny\\_2(z)}=\\frac1{1+ny\\_1}+\\frac1{1+ny\\_2}.\r\n$$\nThen the product $y\\_1(z)y\\_2(z)$ is a decreasing function of $z$ as long as $y\\_1(z)\\le1/n\\le y\\_2(z)$ (the proof is in the addendum below) hence the result holds for $z=0$ as soon as it holds for such a given positive $z$. \n\nIf this is enough to move the value of $y\\_1$ up to $1/n$, the proof is complete.

Next time I run the program however, the data that I added to the lists is gone. I am aware of a question nearly the same as this one, however, I couldn't make sense of the answers because I am very new to python. I'm aware of the pickle module, but I do not understand what it does. If using pickle is my best option, please explain how it works.",
        "answer": "If all you have is a list of some simple type like integers, `pickle` is overkill. You can just write each integer to a line, like this:\n\n```\nwith open('myfile.txt', 'w') as f:\n    for value in values:\n        f.write('{}\\n'.format(value))\n\n```\n\nThen, to read it back in:\n\n```\nvalues = []\nwith open('myfile.txt') as f:\n    for line in f:\n        values.append(int(line))\n\n```\n\nObviously this won't work if you're trying to save strings that might have newlines in them, or more complex data types that are harder to parse than just calling `int`. In that case, you may want to look at JSON, YAML, or Pickle formats.\n\nThe tutorial has a great chapter on [Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) that covers this, and a lot more (although it assumes you've read the previous chapters, or gotten the equivalent information elsewhere, or are willing to go back and read what you've missed if you get confused)."

This is achieved using the combination formula, which gives 9C6 = 84.

The final step involves subtracting the number of groups including the two managers from the total number of possible groups, giving 84 - 35 = 49. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 49."

        "question": "Two excellent students, Alice from EPFL and Bob from MIT, have both built their own spam filters. A spam filter is an algorithm that takes as input an email and outputs $1$ if the email is spam and $0$ otherwise.   Alice and Bob now want to compare their two spam filters. To perform the comparison, they both download the same huge data set consisting of $n$ emails out of which some are spam.  Alice then runs her spam filter on the data set  to obtain $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ where $a_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the output of her spam filter on the $i$:th email in the data set. Similarly, Bob runs his spam filter on the data set to obtain $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ where $b_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the output of his spam filter on the $i$:th email in the data set. Their goal is then to  determine whether their outputs are the same. An issue that they face is that $a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$ are stored on Alice's computer  and $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$ are stored on Bob's computer. They thus need to transfer (or communicate) information to solve the problem. A trivial solution is for Alice to transfer all her outputs  $a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n$ to Bob who then performs the comparison. However, this requires Alice to send $n$ bits of information to Bob; an operation that is very costly for a huge data set. In the following, we use randomization to achieve a huge improvement on the number of bits transfered between Alice and Bob. \\\\[0mm] Specifically, motivated  by something called pseudo-random generators, we  assume that Alice and Bob have access to the same randomness (called shared randomness). That is, Alice and Bob have access to the same infinite stream of random bits $r_1, r_2, \\ldots$. Your task is now to  use this shared randomness to devise a randomized protocol of the following type: \\begin{itemize} \\item As a function of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ and the random bits $r_1, r_2, \\ldots$, Alice computes a message $m$ that consists of only $2$ bits. She then transmits this $2$-bit message $m$   to Bob. \\item Bob then, as a function of $b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_n$, the message $m$, and the random bits $r_1, r_2, \\ldots$, outputs \\textsc{Equal} or \\textsc{Not Equal}. \\end{itemize} Bob's output is correct if he outputs $\\textsc{Equal}$ when $a_i = b_i$ for all $i\\in \\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$ and $\\textsc{Not Equal}$ otherwise. Your protocol should ensure that Bob outputs the correct answer with probability at least $2/3$, where the probability is over the random bits $r_1, r_2, \\ldots $.\\\\ {\\em (In this problem you are asked to (i) explain how Alice computes the message $m$ of $2$ bits (ii) explain how Bob calculates his output, and (iii) prove that Bob's output is correct  with probability at least $2/3$. A correct solution where Alice sends a message $m$ of $O(\\log n)$ bits is rewarded $12$ points.  Recall that you are allowed to refer to material covered in the lecture notes.) }\\\\ \\noindent {\\small An interesting fact (but unrelated to the exam) is that any correct deterministic strategy would require Alice and Bob  to send  $n$ bits of information.}",
        "answer": "Alice and Bob both have built their own spam filters and want to compare their outputs using a randomized protocol that minimizes the number of bits transferred between them. They assume access to the same stream of shared randomness $r_1, r_2, \\ldots$. Alice computes two independent random bit vectors $r^1$ and $r^2$ using the shared randomness, and then computes $x_1 = \\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{r}^1\\rangle \\operatorname{mod} 2$ and $x_2 = \\langle \\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{r}^2 \\rangle \\operatorname{mod} 2$, where $\\mathbf{a}$ is Alice's vector of spam filter outputs. She then transmits the $2$-bit message $(x_1, x_2)$ to Bob. Bob generates the same random bit vectors $r^1$ and $r^2$ using the shared randomness, and computes $y_1 = \\langle \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{r}^1\\rangle \\operatorname{mod} 2$ and $y_2 = \\langle \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{r}^2 \\rangle \\operatorname{mod} 2$, where $\\mathbf{b}$ is Bob's vector of spam filter outputs. If $x_1 = y_1$ and $x_2 = y_2$, Bob outputs \\textsc{Equal}, otherwise he outputs \\textsc{Not Equal}. \n\nTo prove that this protocol is correct with probability at least $2/3$, we first note that it obviously succeeds whenever $\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}$. Thus, we only have to show that it succeeds with probability at least $2/3$ when $\\mathbf{a} \\neq \\mathbf{b}$. We first show that $\\Pr[x_1 = y_1 | \\mathbf{a} \\neq \\mathbf{b}] = 1/2$. This is because $\\Pr[x_1=y_1| \\mathbf{a} \\neq \\mathbf{b}]$ is equal to the probability that the dot product of the difference vector $\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}$ and $r^1$ is even, which is $1/2$ since $\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b}$ has at least one entry that is $\\pm 1$. Similarly, $\\Pr[x_2=y_2| \\mathbf{a} \\neq \\mathbf{b}] = 1/2$. Since $\\mathbf{r}^1$ and $\\mathbf{r}^2$ are independent from each other, $\\Pr[(x_1,x_2)=(y_1,y_2)| \\mathbf{a} \\neq \\mathbf{b}] = (1/2) \\cdot (1/2) = 1/4$, which implies that $\\Pr[(x_1,x_2) \\neq (y_1,y_2)| \\mathbf{a} \\neq \\mathbf{b}]  = 1 - 1/4 \\geq 2/3$ as required. Therefore, Bob's output is correct with probability at least $2/3$. \n\nOverall, this protocol sends only $2$ bits of information between Alice and Bob, which is a significant improvement over the trivial solution that requires sending $n$ bits of information."

        "question": "I have a class that holds some information and one member is a property **options** (an NSUInteger). The individual bits of **options** should be accessible through property getters and setters, to be value-bound to checkboxes:\n\n```\n#define OP_CHAN_TAG   12\n\n@interface MuxConfig: NSObject\n\n@property NSUInteger options;\n@property (nonatomic) BOOL opTagBlocks;\n\n@end\n\n@implementation MuxConfig\n\n- (BOOL) isOpTagBlocks\n{\n  return (_options & (1 << OP_CHAN_TAG));\n}\n\n- (void) setOpTagBlocks:(BOOL)op\n{\n  if (op)\n    _options |= (1 << OP_CHAN_TAG);\n  else\n    _options &= ~(1 << OP_CHAN_TAG);\n}\n\n@end\n\n```\n\nIn this example, a checkbox has a value binding to **opTagBlocks** and an action handler to send the entire **options** property to a hardware device. This mechanism works. Another part of the application can receive the options from said device and stores them as one word into property **options**. And I was hoping that the checkbox(es) got updated but they don't. Obviously accessing property **options** does not 'trigger' the bitwise option handler(s).\nSo the big question is: how can I make this work?",

        "answer": "To obtain the solution, we first notice that the given sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1. We then observe that all the terms from -23 to 23 cancel each other out, leaving only the terms -25 and -24. Thus, the sum of the sequence is equal to -25 + (-24), which simplifies to -49. Therefore, the answer to the problem is -49, which represents the sum of the given arithmetic sequence."

        "question": "### Introduction by @backlin\n\nMultiple simple plots can combined as panels in a single figure by using `layout` or `par(mfrow=...)`. However, more complex plots tend to setup their own panel layout internally disabling them from being used as panels. Is there a way to create a nested layout and encapsulating a complex plot into a single panel?\n\nI have a feeling the `grid` package can accomplish this, e.g. by ploting the panels in separate viewports, but haven't been able to figure out how. Here is a toy example to demonstrate the problem:\n\n```\nmy.plot <- function(){\n    a <- matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)\n    plot.new()\n    par(mfrow=c(2,2))\n    plot(1:10, runif(10))\n    plot(hclust(dist(a)))\n    barplot(apply(a, 2, mean))\n    image(a)\n}\nlayout(matrix(1:4, 2, 2))\nfor(i in 1:4) my.plot()\n# How to avoid reseting the outer layout when calling `my.plot`?\n\n```\n\nOriginal question by @alittleboy\n--------------------------------\n\nI use the `heatmap.2` function in the `gplots` package to generate heatmaps. Here is a sample code for a single heatmap:\n\n```\nlibrary(gplots)\nrow.scaled.expr <- matrix(sample(1:10000),nrow=1000,ncol=10)\nheatmap.2(row.scaled.expr, dendrogram ='row',\n          Colv=FALSE, col=greenred(800), \n          key=FALSE, keysize=1.0, symkey=FALSE, density.info='none',\n          trace='none', colsep=1:10,\n          sepcolor='white', sepwidth=0.05,\n          scale=\"none\",cexRow=0.2,cexCol=2,\n          labCol = colnames(row.scaled.expr),                 \n          hclustfun=function(c){hclust(c, method='mcquitty')},\n          lmat=rbind( c(0, 3), c(2,1), c(0,4) ), lhei=c(0.25, 4, 0.25 ),                 \n)\n\n```\n\nHowever, since I want to compare multiple heatmaps in a single plot, I use `par(mfrow=c(2,2))` and then call `heatmap.2` four times, i.e.\n\n```\nrow.scaled.expr <- matrix(sample(1:10000),nrow=1000,ncol=10)\narr <- array(data=row.scaled.expr, dim=c(dim(row.scaled.expr),4))\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nfor (i in 1:4)\nheatmap.2(arr[ , ,i], dendrogram ='row',\n          Colv=FALSE, col=greenred(800), \n          key=FALSE, keysize=1.0, symkey=FALSE, density.info='none',\n          trace='none', colsep=1:10,\n          sepcolor='white', sepwidth=0.05,\n          scale=\"none\",cexRow=0.2,cexCol=2,\n          labCol = colnames(arr[ , ,i]),                 \n          hclustfun=function(c){hclust(c, method='mcquitty')},\n          lmat=rbind( c(0, 3), c(2,1), c(0,4) ), lhei=c(0.25, 4, 0.25 ),                 \n)\n\n```\n\nHowever, the result is NOT four heatmaps in a single plot, but four separate heatmaps. In other words, if I use `pdf()` to output the result, the file is four pages instead of one. Do I need to change any parameters somewhere? Thank you so much!",
        "answer": "Okay. I suppose this question has been sitting unanswered for enough time that the long answer should be written up.\n\nThe answer to most difficult graphics issues is (as @backlin suggests) the raw use of the 'grid' package. Many prebuilt graphics packages override all current viewports and plot device settings, so if you want something done a very specific way, you have to build it yourself.\n\nI recommend picking up Paul Murrell's book \"R Graphics\" and going over the chapter on the 'grid' package. It's a crazy useful book, and a copy sits on my desk all the time.\n\nFor your heatmap, I've written up a quick primer that will get you started quickly.\n\n**Functions to know**\n\n* `grid.newpage()` This initializes the plotting device. Use it without parameters.\n* `grid.rect()` This draws a rectangle. Your heatmap is basically just a giant set of colored rectangles, so this will be bulk of your graphic. It works like so: `grid.rect(x=x_Position, y=y_Position, width=width_Value, height=height_Value, gp=gpar(col=section_Color, fill=section_Color), just=c(\"left\", \"bottom\"), default.units=\"native\")` The 'just' argument specifies which point of the rectangle will sit on your specified (x, y) coordinates.\n* `grid.text()` This draws text. It works like so: `grid.text(\"Label Text\", x_Value, y_Value, gp=gpar(col=color_Value, cex=font_Size), just=c(\"right\",\"center\"), rot=rot_Degrees, default.units=\"native\")`\n* `grid.lines()` This draws a line. It works like so: `grid.lines(c(x_Start,x_End), c(y_Start, y_End), gp=gpar(col=color_Value), default.units=\"native\")`\n* `dataViewport()` This defines the attributes of a plotting window, which 'grid' refers to as a \"viewport.\" Use it like so: `pushViewport(dataViewport(xData=x_Data, yData=y_Data, xscale=c(x_Min, x_Max), yscale=c(y_Min, y_Max), x=x_Value, y=y_Value, width=width_Value, height=height_Value, just=c(\"left\",\"center\")))` There is some stuff to keep in mind here... see the more detailed explanation of viewports.\n* `pushViewport()` This is used to initialize a veiwport. You wrap this around a viewport definition to actually execute the viewport, like so: `pushViewport(dataViewport([stuff in here]))`\n* `popViewport()` This finalizes a viewport and moves you up one level in the hierarchy of viewports. See the more detailed explanation of viewports.\n\n**Viewports in a nutshell**\n\nViewports are temporary drawing spaces that define where and how 'grid' objects will be drawn. Everything inside the viewport is drawn *relative* to the viewport. If the viewport is rotated, everything inside will be rotated. Viewports can be nested, can overlap, and are almost infinitely flexible, with one exception: they are always a rectangle.\n\nSomething that messes a lot of people up initially is the coordinate system. Every viewport, including the initial 'grid.newpage()' viewport, goes from 0 to 1 on both the x and y axes. The origin (0,0) is the far lower left corner, and the max (1,1) is the far upper right corner. This is the \"npc\" unit system, and everything that doesn't have a set of units specified will likely end up being drawn according to this system. This means two things for you:\n\n1. Use the \"npc\" system when specifying viewport sizes and locations. Just assume that your viewports have to use the \"npc\" coordinates, and you'll save yourself a LOT of hassle. This means if I want to draw two plots next to each other, the definitions for the two viewports would look something like:\n\t* `viewport(x=0, y=0, width=0.5, height=1, just=c(\"left\",\"lower\"))` and\n\t* `viewport(x=0.5, y=0, width=0.5, height=1, just=c(\"left\",\"lower\"))`\n2. If your viewport has a different coordinate system (for example a viewport for plotting a graph), then you will need to specify the 'default.units' argument for every 'grid' object you draw. For instance, if you tried to plot a point at (2,4) you would never see the point, because it would be far off-screen. Specifying `default.units=\"native\"` would tell that point to use the viewport's own coordinate system and would draw the point correctly.\n\nViewports can be navigated and written to directly, but unless you're doing something very automated, it is easier to specify a viewport, draw inside it, and then \"pop\" (finalize) the viewport. This returns you to the parent viewport, and you can start on the next viewport. Popping each viewport is a clutter-free approach and will suit most purposes (and make it easier to debug!).\n\nThe 'dataViewport' function is all important when plotting a graph. This is a special type of viewport that handles all of the coordinates and scales for you, as long as you tell it what data you are using. This is the one I use for any plotting area. When I first started using the 'grid' package, I adjusted all of my values to fit the \"npc\" coordinate system, but that was a mistake! The 'dataViewport' function makes is all easy as long as you remember to use the \"native\" units for each drawing item.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nData visualization is my forte, and I don't mind spending half a day scripting up a good visual. The 'grid' package allows me to create quite sophisticated visuals faster than anything else I found. I script up my visuals as functions, so I can load various data quickly. I couldn't be happier.\n\nHowever, if you don't like to script things, 'grid' will be your enemy. Also, if you consider half a day to be too much time for a visual, then 'grid' won't help you too much. The (in)famous 'ggplot2' package is what most people settle on, and I heartily recommend it, even though I don't personally find it useful.\n\nIf someone wants help learning 'grid' graphics, I'm more than willing to help teach. It has completely revolutionized my ability to create fast, intelligent, and good-looking data visuals."

The very fact that James is speaking of \u201cpure and faultless\u201d religion, there exist an \u201cunclean and imperfect\u201d type of religion as well\u2014a religion not based on love for God. \n\nMany good practices that we have today in the world and some of which have been conveniently adopted by some other religion have their roots in Christian religion. That is why Christian religion is better than other religion and observing the teachings of Jesus Christ is better than not observing them. \n\n**Jesus Christ is the Way to God.** \n\nThat which leads to God is better than that which leads away from God. We have sinfully wandered away from God. Jesus is the guide that leads us back to God. \n\n> \n> Isaiah 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned\u2014every one\u2014to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. \n> \n> \n> \n\nJesus is that Way, the One who came to seek the lost: \n\n> \n> Luke 19:10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.\u201d \n> \n> \n> \n\nHe is, in fact, God Himself in human flesh, so to find Jesus is to find God: \n\n> \n> John 14:9 Jesus said to him, \u201cHave I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, \u2018Show us the Father\u2019? \n> \n> \n> \n\n**Jesus Christ is the Truth.** \n\nThe Christian religion is truer than other religions because things that are true are better than things that are false. Jesus is \u201cthe Truth\u201d and He is the embodiment of truth, the revelation of God to humanity. The Christian religion is grounded in truth, being based on a historical Person whose acts were verified by eyewitnesses and recorded by four different biographers. In following Christ, Christians have the utmost regard for truth, as opposed to hollow externals and the hypocrisy of false appearances. The Christian religion is unique in that it forces us to face the truth about ourselves and speak the truth with others. \n\n**Jesus Christ is the Life.** \n\nThe Christian religion is true religion because life is better than death. A religion whose leader is still alive compared to religions whose leaders have all died. Jesus is \u201cthe Life\u201d; He is the source of life, and without Him one cannot truly live (John 1:4;3:36;5:24;10:10). Jesus provides what we need: the Bread that satisfies forever (John 6:35), the Water that gives eternal life (John 4:14;7:37-38), and the Resurrection and the Life (John 11:25). These are not empty claims; Jesus proved His ability to give life by raising from the dead Lazarus (John 11), Jairus\u2019 daughter (Mark 5), and the boy from Nain (Luke 7). Then, after His own death on the cross, Jesus rose again the third day. \n\n**Jesus Christ transforms mankind.** \n\nThe Christian religion is true religion because righteousness is better than wickedness. Other religions may impose conformity to a certain code of behavior, but they have no power to change the heart. Christianity teaches that the believer is \u201cdead to sin\u201d and now lives \u201cin newness of life\u201d (Romans 6:2,4). The Christian\u2019s zeal for doing good has resulted in the founding of countless orphanages, hospitals, clinics, schools, homeless shelters, and emergency relief agencies\u2014all in the name of Christ. The Christian religion is unique in that it does not force change from without but revolutionizes lives from within. \n\n**Jesus Christ is loving.** \n\nThe Christian religion is true religion because love is better than the absence of love. Jesus showed His love for us in providing for our salvation by dying on the cross (John 15:13). Jesus gave His followers a new command: \u201cLove one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another\u201d (John 13:34-35). Christianity is unique in that it is not a system of rules but a celebration of unselfish love."

At the end, it asks me if I want to save the modified personal dictionary and I choose yes.\n\nProblem is the personal dictionary is not saved to disk, and the words highlighted earlier are again flagged again in a new session.\n\nTried the following things recommended elsewhere to no avail:\n\n> \n> (setq ispell-personal-dictionary (expand-file-name \"~/personal-dictionary.txt\") )\n> \n> \n> \n\nAnybody have a solution or workaround for this?

The significance of the symbol '*0*' is its utility as a placeholder when performing complex calculations on paper.\n\nNote that numeral systems prior to the introduction of a symbol Zero, such as [Roman Numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals), had no difficulty maintaining a Base 10 representation system, but simply used different symbols at each power of ten:\n\n* I and V to represent one and five *units* respectively\n* X and L to represent one and five *tens* respectively\n* C and D to represent one and five *hundreds* respectively\n* M to represent one *thousands*\n\nNote that the Romans did not require a Zero placeholder for calculation as they performed calculations on an [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) rather than on paper. The inspiration for an explicit placeholder probably originates, and coincides, with additional representations for the [development of Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_algebra).\n\nThe Ancient Babylonians also had no difficulty maintaining [extensive accounting records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_accounting#Early_development_of_accounting) without a placeholder for Zero by using a [Base 60 numeral system.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_numerals)\n\nThe concept of *nothingness*, the *number zero*, is as old as numbers themselves. However the explicit representation of numerical zero, and specifically its use as a placeholder to simplify the representation of large numbers, is more recent. The [precise origins](https://www.livescience.com/27853-who-invented-zero.html) are debated, but it certainly appears in India and Middle East early in the Christian Era, as well as independently in the Mayan records about the same time."

This is a fairly cool result and one for which you should be able to easily find details online. The linear sorting algorithms exploit further information about the structure of elements to be sorted, rather than just the total order relationship among elements.\n\nEven more generally, optimality of a sorting algorithm depends intimately upon the assumptions you can make about the kind of lists you're going to be sorting (as well as the machine model on which the algorithm will run, which can make even otherwise poor sorting algorithms the best choice; consider bubble sort on machines with a tape for storage). The stronger your assumptions, the more corners your algorithm can cut. Under very weak assumptions about how efficiently you can determine \"sortedness\" of a list, the optimal worst-case complexity can even be $\\Omega(n!)$.\n\nThis answer deals only with complexities. Actual running times of implementations of algorithms will depend on a large number of factors which are hard to account for in a single answer."

        "answer": "`std::string` is really just a typedef, something like:\n\n```\nnamespace std { \n   typedef basic_string<char> string;\n}\n\n```\n\nIt's fairly easy to create a variant for `unsigned char`:\n\n```\ntypedef basic_string<unsigned char> ustring;\n\n```\n\nYou will, however, have to change your code to use a `ustring` (or whatever name you prefer) instead of `std::string` though. \n\nDepending on how you've written your code, that *may* not require editing all the code though. In particular, if you have something like:\n\n```\nnamespace crypto { \n   using std::string;\n\n   class AES { \n      string data;\n      // ..\n    };\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can change the string type by changing only the `using` declaration:\n\n```\nnamespace unsigned_types { \n    typedef std::basic_string<unsigned char> string;\n}\n\n// ...\n\nnamespace crypto {\n    using unsigned_types::string;\n\n    class AES {\n        string data;\n    };\n}\n\n```\n\nAlso note that different instantiations of a template are entirely separate types, even when the types over which they're intantiated are related, so the fact that you can convert implicitly between `char` and `unsigned char` doesn't mean you'll get a matching implicit conversion between `basic_string<char>` and `basic_string<unsigned char>`."

This means that it is possible to derive the stochastic coefficients of the SCFG in extended Chomsky Normal form resulting from the conversion of grammar \\(G_1\\) from the ones that were associated with \\(G_1\\). \n\nExtended Chomsky Normal form is a specific form of context-free grammar that allows for efficient parsing algorithms and is commonly used in natural language processing. In this form, all production rules have either a single non-terminal on the right-hand side or two non-terminals on the right-hand side with a probability associated with them. \n\nTherefore, it is possible to convert a grammar into extended Chomsky Normal form while preserving its stochastic properties. This can be done by introducing new non-terminals and production rules that combine the original non-terminals in the desired way. The probabilities of the new production rules can then be calculated based on the probabilities of the original grammar. \n\nIn conclusion, it is possible to derive the stochastic coefficients of the SCFG resulting from the conversion of grammar \\(G_1\\) to extended Chomsky Normal form from the ones associated with \\(G_1\\)."

To avoid this problem, we can use an acquire-store (or release-load) operation that establishes a memory barrier and ensures that all previous memory accesses are visible before the store. In this case, we can use the `st.acq` instruction to store `r2` with an acquire semantic.\n\nAdditionally, we need to insert a `chk.a` instruction after the store to `r3`. This instruction checks that the address in `r3` is valid and accessible before allowing any subsequent memory access. This is necessary because the shift operation may result in an invalid address, which would cause a segmentation fault.\n\nFinally, we need to convert the load from `r4` to an advanced load (`ld.a`) that also establishes a memory barrier and ensures that all subsequent memory accesses are ordered after the load. We also need to repeat the load and the incrementation of `r1` in the recovery code to handle the case where the `chk.a` instruction fails."

Some of them have 12 or even more pistons in their engines.\n\nBut if your goal is to increase power, why would you **add more pistons** instead of simply **increasing the size of the cylinders?**\n\nExample: The [P-51 Mustang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_P-51_Mustang) had a V12 engine with a total displacement of 27 liters. So that's 2.25 L per cylinder. Instead, why not have a V4 engine with the same total displacement, which would have been 6.75 L per cylinder?\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but...\n-------------------------------\n\nSuch \"collectivizing\" of the cylinders would be more efficient for a number of reasons. The friction of piston rings scraping the cylinder would be less, meaning less oil and more power. The crankshaft and related things could be shorter. I believe it would be lighter for another reason too: the surface area goes up less than the volume (squared versus cubed). Probably the engine as a whole would be simpler.\n\nI believe this concept can be applied to radial engines as well as inline engines. I made an assumption that 4-stroke engine needs a minimum of 4 cylinders. Today that is not true but during WW2 with the technology of the time, I'm not sure. There were radial engines with 3 cylinders. I'm unaware of any 4-stroke engines with 2 or less cylinders in that era.\n\nAnyway, why not just make the cylinders bigger?",
        "answer": "You said it yourself with the surface-area-to-volume-ratio. You have to get the heat out of the cylinders, and if they're too big you can't do that effectively. It's also difficult to get even, complete, rapid combustion as the volume increases."

Here is the offending code snippet.\n\n```\npublic void playOneTurn(int player) {\n    waiting = true;\n    while (waiting) {\n        // Do nothing, touchEvent will change waiting.\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nI meant for this method to simply wait for a valid spot to be selected and for `waiting` to be flipped in the `ButtonListener`:\n\n```\n    class ButtonListener implements ActionListener {\n    @Override\n    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n        System.out.println(\"TOUCHEVENT\");\n\n        for (i = 0; i < size; i++)\n            for (j = 0; j < size; j++)\n                if (e.getSource() == cells[i][j]) {\n                    if (model[i][j] == 'e') {\n                        cells[i][j].setText(\"\");\n                        currentSpot[0] = i;\n                        currentSpot[1] = j;\n                        if (count % 2 == 0) {\n                            cells[i][j].setBackground(Color.GREEN);\n                            cells[i][j].setIcon(X_MARK);\n                            model[i][j] = 'x';\n                            count++;\n                            waiting = false;\n                        } else {\n                            cells[i][j].setBackground(Color.CYAN);\n                            cells[i][j].setIcon(O_MARK);\n                            model[i][j] = 'o';\n                            count++;\n                            waiting = false;\n\n                        }\n\n                    } else {\n                        System.out.println(\"Hey, you can't move there silly!\");\n                    }\n                }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nI know nothing about threads but I believe that the `ButtonListener` is starting a thread, and because of the way I'm waiting on it, with the `while` loop, the thread is never stopped to let the rest of my code run on certain machines.\n\nIs my error in using the while loop to wait on an Event to flip a boolean, and if so, how would I properly wait for it?",
        "answer": "Do not simply use `while(true)` loop. It will take up your CPU usage. Use `synchronization` instead. Create a `private final Object` and call `wait()` on it. Prior to this send a reference of this object to the MessageListener. When your operation in MessageListener is completed you can call `notify()` on it.\n\nAlso take care of [Spurious wakeups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_wakeup)."

Person B covers an additional distance of 1 kilometer in 1 hour and 48 minutes (9/5 hours), resulting in a relative speed of B over A of 1/(9/5) or 5/9. Thus, the speed of person B is equal to the speed of person A plus 5/9.

        "answer": "Explanation: \n\nClass imbalance refers to a situation where the distribution of classes in the dataset is not balanced, i.e., some classes have significantly more samples than others. This can be a problem in classification tasks because the model can become biased towards the majority class and overlook the minority class.\n\nThe correct answer states that in classification, the distribution of classes should be the same in both the validation set and the full dataset. This means that the validation set should have the same proportion of samples from each class as the full dataset. This is important because if the validation set has an imbalanced class distribution, it can lead to overfitting and inaccurate evaluation of the model's performance.\n\nTherefore, to ensure accurate evaluation of a classification model, it is important to maintain a balanced class distribution in both the training and validation sets. This can be achieved through techniques such as stratified sampling and oversampling/undersampling of the minority class."

This means that the model may have learned to recognize the actions in the specific frames that were labeled by the company, but may not be able to accurately classify actions in frames that it has not seen before. This is a common challenge in machine learning, where models can overfit to the training data and fail to generalize to new data.
