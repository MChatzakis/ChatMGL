Now I can't start vlc media player nor play any file using vlc. It sort of opens and then immediately closes down automatically. I get this when I try opening `vlc` in the terminal:\n\n```\nVLC media player 2.1.4 Rincewind (revision 2.1.4-0-g2a072be)\n[0x8f6d910] main libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface.

VLC media player\n2.1.4 Rincewind\nCommand Line Interface initialized. Type `help' for help.\n\n```\n\nI have installed ubuntu anew twice because of this vlc problem. But only this time I realised it was due to uninstallation of ubuntu-web-browser that vlc stops working. I know this because I tested that vlc runs before I uninstalled the mines and the other games and then ubuntu browser. But after uninstalling these, vlc won't start. So I suspect uninstalling these is the cause.\n\nNow my question is if vlc depended on some packages that were uninstalled due to uninstallation of some other stuff, then why would those packages be removed even when vlc had dependency on them? (am I wrong, or missing something?) How are the dependencies maintained during uninstallation? Also, how can I get vlc running without installing ubuntu again?\n\n**New absurd observation:**\n\nI uninstalled the games in ubuntu using the following command found [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/32228/how-can-i-remove-all-default-installed-games)\n\n```\nsudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-mahjongg gnomine gnome-sudoku aisleriot\n\n```\n\nand same problem occurs !!! Vlc stopped working, and same error message in terminal!\nAnyone knows what the problem is, and how to solve it?\n\n**Yet another absurd observation**\n\nThis time I uninstalled the games using `apt-get remove`, but vlc keeps working. Then `unity-tweak-tool` gives error message while starting. This was solved by installing `unity-webapps-service` as said [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/449943/com-canonical-unity-webapps-schema-is-missing-what-does-this-mean).

The value of the number indicates the quantity of your specified character to look for before returning the remaining piece of the string. If the character you are searching for does not exist, the entire field value will be returned.\n\nIn this case, a -2 would return everything to the right of the second to last space, which doesn't exist in this example, so the entire field value will be returned."

The answer suggests considering a graph consisting of a single cycle with $n$ vertices and $n$ edges. \n\nTo see why this graph has $n \\choose 2$ minimum cuts, we can imagine removing any two edges from the cycle. This will result in two disconnected subgraphs, each of which contains a path with at least two vertices. Cutting along this path will separate the two subgraphs and create a minimum cut. Since there are $n \\choose 2$ ways of selecting two edges from the $n$ edges in the cycle, we have $n \\choose 2$ minimum cuts in total.\n\nTherefore, the graph with a single cycle of $n$ vertices is an example of a graph with $n \\choose 2$ minimum cuts, which shows that Karger's result is tight."

Given that mn = 6 x 210 = 1260, we can substitute this value into the equation to get (n + m)/1260 = 2/35. Cross-multiplying, we obtain 35(n + m) = 2520, which simplifies to n + m = 72.

        "answer": "you can use [File::Basename](http://search.cpan.org/~jesse/perl-5.12.2/lib/File/Basename.pm) - Parse file paths into directory, filename and suffix and [Schwartzian transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform) to sort files on the basis of filename like, \n\n```\n @files = map { $_->[0] }\n    sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] }\n    map { [$_, fileparse($_, \"\\.html?\")] } @files; \n\n```\n\nThe `fileparse()` routine of File::Basename divides a file path into its `$directories, $filename and (optionally) the filename $suffix.` so get the `filename` and pass it into `Schwartzian transform` for sorting."

        "question": "I have a Canon Powershot A710 and I previously had a previous Powershot A-series model. I love them due to the high amount of control they offer. Sadly, they both suck in low light conditions, their flash is very unresponsive, and the camera takes several seconds preparing itself for the next shot after a flash shot. And even then, the pictures they take in low light/flash are as bad as good are those with good light.\n\nI'd like a camera which gives a lot of control options, but what do I need to look for to find one that's great in low light, with or without flash?",
        "answer": "For both cases I strongly recommend looking for something with\n\n* a fast lens (A 2.0 aperture is faster than 2.8 for example)\n* reasonable ISO handling (at least 400, but preferably 800)\n* the biggest sensor available\n\nThe sum of these factors are really critical for low light situations.\n\nIn 2012, both the Canon S110 and the Lumix LX7 offered that set of characteristics. If you don't mind a slight bulkier camera, you could also consider the Canon G15 due to its movable LCD.\n\nAnd last but not least, if you can afford the extra cost, the Sony NEX (the NEX 5N for example) and the micro four thirds offers from Panasonic (such as the GF5 and GX1) and Olympus (such as the E-PM2 and E-PL5) are certainly better than the previous options and offer the flexibility of interchangeable lenses. A middle ground, offering interchangeable lenses but a smaller sensor, would include the Pentax Q and the Nikon 1 cameras.\n\nNote that these are current examples, but the market is always offering new cameras. The important thing to keep in mind is the sum of the above mentioned factors (fast lens, ISO handling and sensor size)."

        "answer": "The problem is that GenericTraversableTemplate is used twice: once for mutable collections (where its type parameter should be invariant), and once for immutable collections (where covariance is invariably king).\n\nGenericTraversableTemplate's typechecks assuming either covariance or invariance for the A type parameter. However, when we inherit it in a mutable trait, we have to pick invariance. Conversely, we'd like covariance in an immutable subclass.\n\nSince we can't abstract over the variance annotation (yet ;-)) in GenericTraversableTemplate, so that we could have instantiated it to either one depending on the subclass, we have to resort to casting (@uncheckVariance is essentially a kind-cast).

To compute this result in parallel, the function defines a nested function called `minMaxPar` that takes a range of indices (from `from` to `until`) and returns a tuple of two integers, using either sequential or parallel processing depending on the size of the range. If the range is smaller than a threshold value `threshold`, the function loops over the elements in the range and updates the min and max values as it goes, then returns the tuple of the min and max values. If the range is larger than the threshold, the function splits the range in two and processes the two halves recursively in parallel using the `parallel` function, which creates two tasks and waits for them to complete, then combines their results by taking the min and max values of the two tuples. The `minMax` function calls the `minMaxPar` function with the full range of indices (from 0 to the size of the array) and returns its result."

We then construct two feasible solutions $y^+$ and $y^-$ that are convex combinations of $x^*$ and differ from $x^*$ only slightly on the variables corresponding to $V^+$ and $V^-$, respectively. By choosing $\\epsilon$ small enough, we can ensure that $y^+$ and $y^-$ satisfy the boundary constraints and the edge constraints. Moreover, we have $x^* = \\frac{1}{2} y^+ + \\frac{1}{2} y^-$, which contradicts the assumption that $x^*$ is an extreme point. \n\nThus, we conclude that any extreme point $x^*$ satisfies $x^*_v \\in \\{0, \\frac12, 1\\}$ for every $v\\in V$. This result is useful because it implies that we can restrict our attention to half-integral solutions when searching for an optimal vertex cover.

The same for `catch` except it's a different list.\n\nHere's an example\n\n```js\nfunction makePromiseParts() {\r\n  let resolve;\r\n  let reject;\r\n  const promise = new Promise((_resolve, _reject) => {\r\n    log('--in promise--');\r\n    resolve = _resolve;\r\n    reject = _reject;\r\n  });\r\n  return {\r\n    promise,\r\n    resolve,\r\n    reject,\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\nfunction wait() {\r\n  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve));\r\n}\r\n\nasync function main() {\r\n  {\r\n    log('--start--');\r\n\n    const p = makePromiseParts();\r\n\n    log('--after make promise--');\r\n\n    p.promise.then(() => { log('then 1'); });\r\n    p.promise.then(() => { log('then 2'); });\r\n\n    log('--before resolve--');\r\n\n    p.resolve();\r\n\n    log('--after resolve--');\r\n\n    await wait();\r\n\n    log('--after waiting--');\r\n\n    p.promise.then(() => { log('then 3'); });\r\n    p.promise.then(() => { log('then 4'); });\r\n\n    log('--before waiting--');\r\n\n    await wait();\r\n\n    log('--end--');\r\n  }\r\n\n  await wait();\r\n  log(' ');\r\n\n  {\r\n    log('--start--');\r\n\n    const p = makePromiseParts();\r\n\n    log('--after make promise--');\r\n\n    p.promise.catch(() => { log('catch 1'); });\r\n    p.promise.catch(() => { log('catch 2'); });\r\n\n    log('--before reject--');\r\n\n    p.reject();\r\n\n    log('--after reject--');\r\n\n    await wait();\r\n\n    log('--after waiting--');\r\n\n    p.promise.catch(() => { log('catch 3'); });\r\n    p.promise.catch(() => { log('catch 4'); });\r\n\n    log('--before waiting--');\r\n\n    await wait();\r\n\n    log('--end--');\r\n  }\r\n\n}\r\nmain();\r\n\nfunction log(...args) {\r\n  const elem = document.createElement('pre');\r\n  elem.textContent = [...args].join(' ');\r\n  document.body.appendChild(elem);\r\n}\n```\n\n```css\npre { margin: 0; }\n```\n\nTo put it another way, `then` takes a function that says `call this function if and when you're resolved` and `catch` takes a function that says `call this function if and when you're rejected`."

        "answer": "The question describes a scenario where a classification problem is being solved on a dataset that has an outlier. An outlier is a point that is significantly far away from the other points in the dataset. The dataset is linearly separable, meaning that a line or hyperplane can be drawn to separate the datapoints belonging to different classes.\n\nThe question then goes on to describe how three different models, namely SVM, logistic regression, and 1-nearest-neighbour, are trained on this dataset. These models are then tested on a test set that is drawn from the same distribution as the training set but does not have any outliers.\n\nAfter testing, the outlier is removed from the dataset and the models are retrained. The question asks how the decision boundaries of the three models would change after retraining.\n\nThe correct answer explains that the SVM solution only depends on the support vectors, which are the datapoints that lie on the margins of the SVM decision boundary. Since the outlier is not a support vector, removing it would not change the SVM decision boundary.\n\nFor the 1-nearest-neighbour classifier, decisions are based on the nearest datapoints. As the outlier is significantly far away from the other datapoints, it would not have any effect on the decisions of the 1-nearest-neighbour classifier. Therefore, removing the outlier would not change the decision boundary of this model either.\n\nHowever, the decision boundary of the logistic regression model would change after retraining as the solution of logistic regression depends on all datapoints in the dataset. Removing the outlier would change the solution, and hence the decision boundary of the logistic regression model.\n\nIn summary, the outlier had no effect on the SVM and 1-nearest-neighbour models, but it did have an effect on the logistic regression model. Removing the outlier from the dataset would not change the decision boundaries of the SVM and 1-nearest-neighbour models, but it would change the decision boundary of the logistic regression model."

        "answer": "The number of individuals in the group whose age is less than 20 is determined as the difference between the total number of individuals in the group (160) and the number of individuals aged 20 or above (90), resulting in a value of 70. The probability, denoted as p, of selecting a person at random from the group who is under 20 years of age is calculated by dividing the number of individuals whose age is less than 20 by the total number of individuals in the group, which results in a value of 0.4375 or approximately 0.44. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.44."

        "question": "I've inherited some code that uses the elm-chaN fatfs. It creates Directories and files with either missing or wrong date-time stamps. I've traced the problem to what appears to be an incorrect cast. \n\nI changed the cast and things seem to work. But I would like confirmation from more experienced programmers that the original cast was incorrectly constructed (or a compiler issue) \n\nBelow is the original code: the curTime stuct assigns uint16\\_t to \"Year\". The other members are uint8\\_t types. They need to be packed into 32b word (DWORD) following the DOS date/time bitmap format.\n\n```\n{\n    DWORD tmr;\n\n    /* Pack date and time into a DWORD variable */\n    Calendar curTime = sdInterface->sdGetRTCTime();\n\n    tmr = ((DWORD)(curTime.Year-1980)<<25)\n            | ((DWORD)(curTime.Month) << 21)\n            | ((DWORD)(curTime.DayOfMonth) << 16)\n            | (curTime.Hours << 11)\n            | (curTime.Minutes << 5)\n            | (curTime.Seconds >> 1); //modified to truncate into two second intervals - jn\n\n    return tmr;\n}\n\n```\n\nBelow is the modified code: I explicitly cast the Hours, Minutes and seconds to DWORD type. It is puzzling as to why the original author would cast Month, DayOfMonth but not the other uint8\\_t types. \n\n```\nDWORD get_fattime(void)\n{\n    DWORD tmr;\n\n    /* Pack date and time into a DWORD variable */\n    Calendar curTime = sdInterface->sdGetRTCTime();\n\n    tmr = ((DWORD)(curTime.Year-1980)<<25)\n            | ((DWORD)(curTime.Month) << 21)\n            | ((DWORD)(curTime.DayOfMonth) << 16)\n            | ((DWORD)(curTime.Hours) << 11)\n            | ((DWORD)(curTime.Minutes) << 5)\n            | ((DWORD)(curTime.Seconds) >> 1); //modified to truncate into two second intervals - jn\n\n    return tmr;\n}\n\n```\n\nthe code seems to work. Would like a sanity check from more experienced programmers. \n\nI am updating this post to provide the requested information: first is the struct Calendar curTime. \n\n```\n//\n//! \\brief Used in the RTC_C_initCalendar() function as the CalendarTime\n//! parameter.\n//\n//*****************************************************************************\ntypedef struct Calendar {\n    //! Seconds of minute between 0-59\n    uint8_t Seconds;\n    //! Minutes of hour between 0-59\n    uint8_t Minutes;\n    //! Hour of day between 0-23\n    uint8_t Hours;\n    //! Day of week between 0-6\n    uint8_t DayOfWeek;\n    //! Day of month between 1-31\n    uint8_t DayOfMonth;\n    //! Month between 1-12\n    uint8_t Month;\n    //! Year between 0-4095\n    uint16_t Year;\n} Calendar;\n\n```\n\nThe image below shows the directory of the SD Card running the original code (without the DWORD cast on the Hour, Minute and Time uint8\\_t objects). Notice the missing date time stamp on two of the files. The directories are also missing their date time stamps. \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sfg0a.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sfg0a.jpg)\n\nAnd the last two images below shows the results of the code with DWORD applied to the uint9\\_t objects. Both directories and files now have date time stamps.\n\n[![Directories now have correct timestamps](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMP30.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMP30.png)\n\n[![And the files also have correct timestamps](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCYg2.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCYg2.png)\n\nFrom the comments I received so far, I am leaning towards this being a compiler error. The code was developed on earlier version of the compiler. This is a new compiler CCS v9.",
        "answer": "[This is not really an answer, but it's too elaborate for a comment.]\n\nPlease try this program:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    uint8_t b = 9;\n    DWORD w1 = b << 6;\n    DWORD w2 = (DWORD)b << 6;\n    printf(\"%d %d\\n\", (int)w1, (int)w2);\n}\n\n```\n\nThe expected output of this program is\n\n```\n576 576\n\n```\n\nShifting right by 6 bits is equivalent to multiplying by 64, and 9 \u00d7 64 = 576, so this makes sense.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you get the output\n\n```\n64 576\n\n```\n\nI believe this indicates a bug in your compiler. 64 is what you get if you take 9 and shift it left by 6 bits *within an 8-bit field*, meaning that you lose a bit off the left.\n\nThat (almost) makes sense, and it's what the answer posted by @jaz\\_n is getting at. However, your compiler is not supposed to shift anything left within an 8-bit field. When you write\n\n```\nx << 6\n\n```\n\nwhere `x` is type `uint8_t`, the first thing the compiler is supposed to do is promote `x` to a full-width integer type, *then* shift it left by 6 bits, in a field that's as wide as type `int` on your machine (which will obviously be either 16 or 32 bits, typically).\n\nThis explains why the three \"extra\" casts to `DWORD` should *not* be necessary. The fact that you had to add them suggests that your compiler may have a problem. If your compiler generates code that prints `64 576` for my test, this is additional evidence that your compiler is wrong."

        "answer": "I'm surprised I found only a few questions like this one. I had a similar requirement and I managed to solve it using a combination of absolute positioned elements and *vw* units.\n\nBasically, a wrapper element has the background color of the left side to make it look like it extends to the border of the screen and an absolute positioned div with the same width of the viewport extends as background of the right side.\n\nYou can see it working in [this codepen](http://codepen.io/fabkast/pen/KVoVXX)\n\nMarkup goes like this\n\n```\n<div class=\"wrapper\"> <!-- to style bg without with messing with container margins -->\n  <div class=\"container\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-8 left\"></div>    \n      <div class=\"col-md-4 right\">\n        <div class=\"bg\"><!-- additional element that will act as background --></div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n```\n\nAnd css:\n\n```\n/* Wrapper has the bg color of left side */\n.wrapper,\n.left {\n  background-color: blue;\n}\n\n/* Right container */\n.right {\n  background-color: pink;\n  position: relative; /* Let it have absolute positioned children  */\n  z-index: 0;\n}\n\n.right .bg {\n  background-color: pink;\n\n  /* Following will make our bg element the same size as its parent\n   and will put it behind it making it look like a background */\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 0;\n  top: 0;\n  height: 100%;\n  z-index: -1;\n\n  width: 100%; // fallback for old browsers, bg will be same size as its parent\n  width: 100vw; // Have the bg the same width as the screen, making the bg hang outside the screen\n\n}\n\n```\n\n**Note** that as bg will hang outside the container, you will need the `wrapper` div or one of its parent to have its `overflow-x` property as `hidden`, otherwise horizontal scrolling bars will appear.\n\nIf you have some specific elements inside your right column you can even use css pseudo elements like `:before` to avoid the declaration of the `bg` element. \n\nAlso, you need to set the appropriate screen breakpoints to style this for smaller screen sizes."

In this exercise, we will consider a variant of the problem called circular coloring, still on random regular graphs of degree d. The color-variables si on the nodes of the graph can take one of q colors, si \u2208 {1, . . . , q}. The rule of circular coloring is that the two nodes of each edge can take two consecutive colors modulo q. For instance, for q = 4 only the following color combinations are allowed for a given edge {(1, 2),(2, 3),(3, 4),(4, 1)} (in contrast with the normal graph coloring pairs (1, 3) and (2, 4) are not allowed for circular coloring). A graph is considered circular q-colorable if and only if there is an assignment of colors to nodes such that each edge is in the allowed list. Consider now q = 5. What can you deduce about circular 5-colorability of d regular graphs for d = 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . ?",
        "answer": "The question asks about the circular $5$-colorability of random regular graphs of degree $d$. Circular coloring is a variant of the normal coloring problem, where the two nodes of each edge can take two consecutive colors modulo $q$. In this case, $q=5$, and we are asked to determine the circular $5$-colorability of random regular graphs with degrees $d=2,3,4,5,...$.\n\nThe answer provides a formula for the low-temperature limit of the entropy, which counts the number of allowed circular $q$-colorings of the graph. If the entropy in this limit is positive, the graph is colorable. For $d$-regular graphs, the entropy formula becomes $S=\\log(q)+\\frac{c}{2}\\log(\\frac{2}{q})$, where $c=d$. \n\nUsing this formula, we can determine the circular $5$-colorability of random regular graphs for different values of $d$. For $d\\leq 3$, the entropy is positive, implying that the graphs are circular $5$-colorable. However, for $d>3$, the entropy becomes negative, indicating that the graphs are not circular $5$-colorable. \n\nIt is important to note that this implication only works in one direction. There could be other solutions to the fixed point equations that might achieve positive entropy, which would mean that the graphs are colorable even for $d>3$."

This allows us to estimate the number of layers of atoms on the foil, which is approximately 120,000. The estimated size of an aluminum atom is 1.43 \u00c5, and each layer of atoms is estimated to be 1.7 \u00c5 thick, which differs by 16% due to the idealized model.

        "answer": "Basically we want things to behave sensibly.\n\nConsider the following problem:\n\nI am given a group of rectangles and I want to increase their area by 10%. So what I do is I set the length of the rectangle to 1.1 times what it was before.\n\n```cs\npublic void IncreaseRectangleSizeByTenPercent(IEnumerable<Rectangle> rectangles)\n{\n  foreach(var rectangle in rectangles)\n  {\n    rectangle.Length = rectangle.Length * 1.1;\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow in this case, all of my rectangles now have their length increased by 10%, which will increase their area by 10%. Unfortunately, someone has actually passed me a mixture of squares and rectangles, and when the length of the rectangle was changed, so was the width.\n\nMy unit tests pass because I wrote all my unit tests to use a collection of rectangles. I now have introduced a subtle bug into my application which can go unnoticed for months.\n\nWorse still, Jim from accounting sees my method and writes some other code which uses the fact that if he passes squares into my method, that he gets a very nice 21% increase in size. Jim is happy and nobody is any wiser.\n\nJim gets promoted for excellent work to a different division. Alfred joins the company as a junior. In his first bug report, Jill from Advertising has reported that passing squares to this method results in a 21% increase and wants the bug fixed. Alfred sees that Squares and Rectangles are used everywhere in the code and realises that breaking the inheritance chain is impossible. He also does not have access to Accounting's source code. So Alfred fixes the bug like this:\n\n```cs\npublic void IncreaseRectangleSizeByTenPercent(IEnumerable<Rectangle> rectangles)\n{\n  foreach(var rectangle in rectangles)\n  {\n    if (typeof(rectangle) == Rectangle)\n    {\n      rectangle.Length = rectangle.Length * 1.1;\n    }\n    if (typeof(rectangle) == Square)\n    {\n      rectangle.Length = rectangle.Length * 1.04880884817;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nAlfred is happy with his uber hacking skills and Jill signs off that the bug is fixed.\n\nNext month nobody gets paid because Accounting was dependent on being able to pass squares to the `IncreaseRectangleSizeByTenPercent` method and getting an increase in area of 21%. The entire company goes into \"priority 1 bugfix\" mode to track down the source of the issue. They trace the problem to Alfred's fix. They know that they have to keep both Accounting and Advertising happy. So they fix the problem by identifying the user with the method call like so:\n\n```cs\npublic void IncreaseRectangleSizeByTenPercent(IEnumerable<Rectangle> rectangles)\n{\n  IncreaseRectangleSizeByTenPercent(\n    rectangles, \n    new User() { Department = Department.Accounting });\n}\n\npublic void IncreaseRectangleSizeByTenPercent(IEnumerable<Rectangle> rectangles, User user)\n{\n  foreach(var rectangle in rectangles)\n  {\n    if (typeof(rectangle) == Rectangle || user.Department == Department.Accounting)\n    {\n      rectangle.Length = rectangle.Length * 1.1;\n    }\n    else if (typeof(rectangle) == Square)\n    {\n      rectangle.Length = rectangle.Length * 1.04880884817;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\nThis anecdote is based on real-world situations that face programmers daily. Violations of the Liskov Substitution principle can introduce very subtle bugs that only get picked up years after they're written, by which time fixing the violation will break a bunch of things and *not fixing* it will anger your biggest client.\n\nThere are two realistic ways of fixing this problem.\n\nThe first way is to make Rectangle immutable. If the user of Rectangle cannot change the Length and Width properties, this problem goes away. If you want a Rectangle with a different length and width, you create a new one. Squares can inherit from rectangles happily.\n\nThe second way is to break the inheritance chain between squares and rectangles. If a square is defined as having a single `SideLength` property and rectangles have a `Length` and `Width` property and there is no inheritance, it's impossible to accidentally break things by expecting a rectangle and getting a square. In C# terms, you could `seal` your rectangle class, which ensures that all Rectangles you ever get are actually Rectangles.\n\nIn this case, I like the \"immutable objects\" way of fixing the problem. The identity of a rectangle is its length and width. It makes sense that when you want to change the identity of an object, what you really want is a *new* object. If you lose an old customer and gain a new customer, you don't change the `Customer.Id` field from the old customer to the new one, you create a new `Customer`.\n\nViolations of the Liskov Substitution principle are common in the real world, mostly because a lot of code out there is written by people who are incompetent/ under time pressure/ don't care/ make mistakes. It can and does lead to some very nasty problems. In most cases, you want to [favour composition over inheritance](http://codingdelight.com/2014/01/16/favor-composition-over-inheritance-part-1/) instead."

If not, it's a matter of working out what the key goals and routes through the site are. Find out the range of audiences for the site, and what these people want. Then, your design should be tailored around making these clear, easy, intuitive and obvious.\n* **Branding.** The site should get across the brand personality of the client. They might already have a clear visual brand, in which case, study that, study their competitors, understand how they want this site to be seen, make **mood boards**, and come up with ideas. If they don't, and creating a visual brand is part of the job, that's a whole separate question (also, bill accordingly!).\n\nFor **the client**, there might be an account manager who's in charge of making you understand the client's needs and making the client understand why your designs are a good idea. \n\nIf there isn't, this comes down to people skills. Ask questions, get them to show you examples of what they like *and have them explain why they like it*, and get lots of feedback at every step. No matter how small the job, get **a proper brief written up and signed** (you'll probably need to help them write this up unless they've got an experienced design account manager), and a contract which gives you room to charge more if they go against the agreed brief and change their mind about what they want mid-project. Make sure they understand that idea development is as much a part of the work as the final finished product.\n\nYour ability to get them to sign off a design (and then sign off your cheque) will depend on how well you understand what they want, so really get inside their head.\n\n---\n\nWhen you've done this, you should have a crystal clear idea of what you're doing and why, and ideas should come naturally. Develop several ideas - don't just go with the first one you like, compete with yourself trying to beat your last favourite idea. Test often, and get other people's feedback often (*especially* from the client).\n\nAlso, keep in mind this classic diagram of the creative process from Daniel Newman:\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qtjty.jpg)\n\nFinishing *making* the thing is the easy bit."

The points a and b are located at a distance r (much smaller than the radius of the loop) from the wire in the direction of the $\\hat{x}$ axis. An electron is present at point b with a velocity $\u000bec{v}_e= -v_e \\hat{e}_z$. We are asked to determine the orientation of the magnetic field induced at point a.\n\nThe correct answer is (c): The magnetic field at point a is oriented along the $\\hat{e}_y$ axis. \n\nTo understand why this is the case, we need to use the right-hand rule for the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire. If we wrap our right hand around the wire with our thumb pointing in the direction of the current (which is $\\hat{e}_z$ in this case), the fingers of our hand curl in the direction of the magnetic field. This means that the magnetic field at point a, which is close to the wire and in the direction of the $\\hat{x}$ axis, will be perpendicular to both the current direction and the radial direction towards the center of the loop. \n\nTo determine the exact orientation of the magnetic field at point a, we can use the right-hand rule again. If we point our fingers in the direction of the radial vector $\\hat{e}_r$ at point a and curl them towards the direction of the current $\\hat{e}_z$, our thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field. This means that the magnetic field at point a will be in the $\\hat{e}_heta$ direction in the cylindrical coordinate system $(a, \\hat{e}_r, \\hat{e}_heta, \\hat{e}_z)$, which is perpendicular to both $\\hat{e}_r$ and $\\hat{e}_z$. Finally, since $\\hat{e}_heta$ is perpendicular to both $\\hat{e}_x$ and $\\hat{e}_z$, the magnetic field at point a will be oriented along the $\\hat{e}_y$ axis in the Cartesian coordinate system."

        "answer": "The probability of obtaining a three-digit number with all odd digits is calculated as follows: The first digit cannot be zero, giving us a total of nine possible digits from which to choose. Of these nine digits, five are odd and four are even. Therefore, the probability of selecting an odd digit for the first slot is 5/9, the probability of selecting an odd digit for the second slot is 5/10 (since one digit has already been selected), and the probability of selecting an odd digit for the third slot is also 5/10. Multiplying these probabilities together yields 5/36.\n\nTo find the probability of obtaining at least one even digit, we can subtract the probability of obtaining all odd digits from one. Therefore, the probability of obtaining at least one even digit is 1 - 5/36, which simplifies to 31/36. Hence, the answer is 31/36."

        "answer": "If you only have occasional need of >1GB of swap space, you may consider creating a swap file in addition to the dedicated swap partition, which will avoid having to dig up a live CD/USB and resize partitions.\n\nCreate a swap file:\n\n```\nsudo fallocate -l 3G /swapfile\nsudo chmod 600 /swapfile\nmkswap /swapfile\nswapon /swapfile\n\n```\n\nAdd it to your `/etc/fstab` file so that you don't have to manually re-enable it each boot.\n\n```\n/swapfile none swap sw 0 0\n\n```\n\nYou can set the priority of the two swap areas separately if you want the system to use the dedicated partition with higher priority.

        "answer": "The following operations would cause a transition from user space to kernel space:\n\n1. Dividing integer by 0: This is an illegal operation and will trigger a hardware exception. The exception handler is part of the kernel and will execute in kernel space.\n\n2. Invoking read() syscall: A system call is a request made by a user program to the operating system for a service or resource. When a user program invokes a system call like read(), control is transferred to the kernel, which executes the requested operation in kernel space. Once the operation is complete, control is returned to the user program.\n\n3. Jumping to an invalid address: If a user program attempts to execute an instruction at an invalid memory address, a hardware exception will be raised. The exception handler is part of the kernel and will execute in kernel space.\n\nIn all three cases, the transition from user space to kernel space occurs due to an exception being raised and the kernel taking over to handle the situation."

To determine the relative humidity, we first need to calculate the vapor pressure of the air outside using the ideal gas law. We find that the vapor pressure is approximately 723 Pa. With this information, we can calculate the mole fraction of water vapor in the air outside using the ratio of the vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure at the temperature of 293 K. The resulting mole fraction is approximately 0.31. This means that the air outside contains 31% of the amount of water vapor that it would need to be fully saturated at 293 K. To find the relative humidity of the air inside the house, we would need to repeat these calculations using the temperature and pressure conditions inside the house."

We consider the random case $\\mathbf{x}^\\mu \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\mathbb{1}_{D \times D}\right), y^\\mu \\sim \\operatorname{Unif}(\\{-1,1\\})$, so that the patterns $\\mathbf{x}^\\mu$ are Gaussian vectors with zero mean and unit covariance, and the label $y^\\mu$ are -1 or 1 with equal probability.\nNow suppose you are given a function $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})$ depending on parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ as\n$$\n\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})=\\operatorname{sign}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})\n$$\nWe fix $\\|\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\|^2=D$ without loss of generality. We want the above function to be able to reproduce the label for each pattern. In other words, we are looking for a special $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ such that $y^\\mu=\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{x}^\\mu\right)$ for all $\\mu=1, \\ldots, N$. We call such a vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ a solution.

Since we take the limit $T \rightarrow 0$, we shall instead be interested in the behavior of the minimizer for small $T$ from now on",
        "answer": "For very large values of $T$, we expect the minimizer $q^*$ of the expression in parenthesis in (7) to be close to 1. This is because the term $\\frac{q}{1-q}$ dominates the expression as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$ and hence the minimizer $q^*$ should approach 1.\n\nHowever, in the limit $T \\rightarrow 0$, the $\\omega$ are not going to be constrained, so we expect the overlap to be the scalar product of two random vectors on the sphere. This quantity converges to 0 in the high dimensional limit. To see why, note that the scalar product of two random vectors on the sphere is given by $\\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{i=1}^D u_i v_i$, where $u_i$ and $v_i$ are independent Gaussian variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can approximate this sum as a Gaussian variable with mean 0 and variance $\\frac{1}{D}$. Hence, as $D$ becomes large, the scalar product approaches 0. Therefore, we expect the minimizer $q^*$ to approach 0 in the limit $T \\rightarrow 0$."

        "answer": "The correct answer is:\n\n```\ndef filter(m: Multiset, p: Char => Boolean): Multiset = (c: Char) => if (p(c)) m(c) else 0\n```\n\nThis implementation of the `filter` function takes in a multiset `m` and a predicate function `p` that determines which elements should be included in the filtered multiset. It returns a new multiset that contains only the elements that satisfy the predicate `p`.\n\nThe implementation creates a new function that takes in a character `c` and returns either the count of `c` in the original multiset `m` if `p(c)` is true, or 0 otherwise. This effectively removes any characters from `m` that do not satisfy the predicate `p`.\n\nFor example, if we have a multiset `m` that represents the string \"banana\" and a predicate `p` that checks if a character is a vowel, we can use the `filter` function to create a new multiset that contains only the vowels in `m`:\n\n```\nval m: Multiset = Map('b' -> 1, 'a' -> 3, 'n' -> 2)\nval vowels = Set('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')\nval filtered = filter(m, vowels.contains)\n// filtered is now a multiset that represents the string \"aaa\"\n```"

We can calculate these probabilities by counting the number of times each bigram appears, and dividing by the total number of bigrams. For example, the bigram \"cut the\" appears once in the corpus, so its probability is 1/18.\n\nUsing this method, we can calculate the probabilities of all the observed bigrams in the corpus. The probabilities are proportional to the number of occurrences of each bigram, since MLE assumes that the most likely parameters are those that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.\n\nHowever, both of the sequences given in the question contain an unseen bigram, \"ch\". This means that the probability of each sequence is 0, since the probability of any sequence containing an unseen bigram is the product of the probabilities of each bigram in the sequence, at least one of which is 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability of \"cutthechat\" and \"cut the chat\" are both 0, based on the toy corpus and the MLE estimation method."

        "question": "I've seasoned my cast iron for about 6 times after I got it. It is a 10\" Lodge skillet. I used flaxseed oil for seasoning the cast iron pan. Followed every step found on the web, thin layer, baked at 400 degrees F for about an hour. There was no problem seasoning the pan. It had a shiny finish with NO sticky surface.\n\nHowever, when I fried an egg in the hot pan with a lot of oil, it got stuck badly. I had to scrub the residue with salt. When the pan dried, the seasoning seem to have come off with patchy spots on the pan. How do I fix it? I thought minimal seasoning is going to come off and a seasoned pan is going to be non-stick? Please help.",
        "answer": "I've found that **seasoning is only one part of the equation**. \n\nAnother part is the **texture of the pan**. See myth #6 from Kenji at Serious Eats: [The Truth About Cast Iron Pans: 7 Myths That Need To Go Away](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-truth-about-cast-iron.html)\n\nI've polished my pans with a wirebrush on a drill, a palm sander, and a lot of elbow grease. (I'm sure there are better tools, though.) That's made a significant difference. Now my cast iron is about as good as my Lodge carbon steel pan, which came completely smooth from the factory.\n\nOne other factor that makes a huge difference: **Season your pan immediately before using it.** When I completely preheat my pan with a small amount of oil, scrambled eggs don't stick. I got this tip from Christopher Kimball on America's Test Kitchen Radio a few years back."

        "question": "Review the notion of depth seen in the lecture. What does it represent?  Below is a formula for the depth of a divide and conquer algorithm working on an array segment of size $L$$L$, as a function of $L$$L$. The values $c$$c$, $d$$d$ and $T$$T$ are constants. We assume that $L>0$$L>0$ and $T>0$$T>0$.  $$ D(L) = \\begin{cases} c \\cdot L &\\text{if}\\ L \\leq T \\\\ \\text{max}\\left( D\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac L2 \\right\\rfloor \\right), D\\left(L - \\left\\lfloor \\frac L2 \\right\\rfloor \\right)\\right) + d &\\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$$$ D(L) = \\begin{cases} c \\cdot L &\\text{if}\\ L \\leq T \\\\ \\text{max}\\left( D\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac L2 \\right\\rfloor \\right), D\\left(L - \\left\\lfloor \\frac L2 \\right\\rfloor \\right)\\right) + d &\\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$  Below the threshold T, the algorithm proceeds sequentially and takes time c to process each single element. Above the threshold, the algorithm is applied recursively over the two halves of the array. The results are then merged using an operation that takes d units of time. Is it the case that for all $1 \\leq L_1 \\leq L_2$$1 \\leq L_1 \\leq L_2$ we have $D(L_1) \\leq D(L_2)$$D(L_1) \\leq D(L_2)$?  If it is the case, prove the property by induction on $L$$L$. If it is not the case, give a counterexample showing values of $L_1$$L_1$, $L_2$$L_2$, $c$$c$, and $d$$d$ for which the property does not hold.",
        "answer": "The question asks whether the depth of a divide and conquer algorithm, represented by the formula given, is an increasing function of the input size $L$. The answer is that it is not always the case. A counterexample is provided, with specific values of $L_1$, $L_2$, $T$, $c$, and $d$ that violate the property.\n\nThe counterexample is based on the observation that the depth of the algorithm depends not only on the input size $L$, but also on the threshold $T$, the constants $c$ and $d$, and the specific way the algorithm splits the input. In particular, if $L_2$ is only slightly larger than $L_1$, but the split happens to favor one side over the other, the depth of the algorithm may not increase.\n\nThe given counterexample uses $L_1=10$, $L_2=12$, $T=11$, $c=1$, and $d=1$. With these values, $D(L_1)=10$, since $L_1\\leq T$. However, $D(L_2)=\\max(D(6),D(6))+1=7$, since the input array of size 12 is split into two arrays of size 6, and each subarray is processed independently. Therefore, the depth of the algorithm decreased when the input size increased from $L_1$ to $L_2$, which shows that the property does not hold in general.\n\nThe answer also explains why the property does not hold, namely that the algorithm splits the input into subproblems of equal size whenever possible, which may lead to unbalanced splits and different depths for different input sizes. Finally, the answer provides a general strategy for finding counterexamples, which is to look for values of $L_1$ and $L_2$ that are close but not equal, and try to construct an example where the split is unbalanced."

        "answer": "A dry etching process can be selective, which means that it will only etch the target, not the mask material. Selectivity can be enhanced by tuning the polymerization point of the gas. More polymerization will lead to extra masking material that gets deposited so that the mask can withstand the etching longer. Increasing the monomer concentration, increasing H2 concentration, decreasing the temperature and increasing the pressure are some of the valid methods to increase the selectivity.

A spacecraft must be held in a specific position and engines must fire at exactly the right time and for the right amount of time. Gyroscopes and timers can give you a fair amount of accuracy, so you don't need a computer for that (although it really helps).\n\nThe biggest challenge without a computer would be the mathematical calculations, which can be done by hand as long as you have a room full of human computers to back you up.

In other words, for any point in an open set, there exists a small enough interval around that point that is still contained within the set. \n\nFalse: There exists a family of open intervals \\(I_1,I_2,I_3,\\dots\\) such that \\(A=I_1\\cup I_2\\cup I_3\\cup\\cdots\\). \n\nExplanation: This statement is false because not all open sets can be expressed as a countable union of open intervals. For example, the set of all rational numbers is an open set, but it cannot be expressed as a countable union of open intervals. This is known as the Baire Category Theorem."

        "answer": "The \"difficulty\" of a question is certainly hard to classify. There is a large amount of subjectivity to the issue -- for example, a question about mathematics will likely seem harder to a person with no mathematics background in their education.\n\nYou can't classify the \"difficultly\" of questions in general with an algorithm; you'll have to do it yourself.\n\nOne such strategy might be to introduce the concept of topics into your game, and lump each question into one or topics. Within that topic, assign each question a difficulty level (manually, based on your own personal assessment of the question). Then sorting from easy-to-hard becomes a simple matter of sorting on the scale you define for the difficulty (for example, one to ten). The topic does not need to participate in the sort, it's purely for taxonomic purposes. \n\nYou'll probably have to tweak those difficulties during play-testing. I'd suggest building in a feedback mechanism into your beta builds -- after every question, show the user the topic and difficulty of the question (as in, \"that question had a difficulty of 3/10 in the math topic. Do you agree with that difficulty assessment?\") and record their responses so you can make adjustments.\n\nAs with all data-collection programs, make sure your beta testers are aware that you'll be collecting their responses to these questions."

        "answer": "The question asks whether the given differential $\\partial f$ is total. To verify this, we need to calculate the cross derivatives using partial differentiation. If the cross derivatives are equal, then the result is independent of the order of differentiation, and the differential is total (by the Schwarz theorem). \n\nThe first cross derivative is calculated by taking the partial derivative of the partial derivative of $\\partial f$ with respect to $x$ with respect to $y$. This gives us $2x-1/x^2$. The second cross derivative is calculated by taking the partial derivative of the partial derivative of $\\partial f$ with respect to $y$ with respect to $x$. This also gives us $2x-1/x^2$. Since the cross derivatives are equal, the differential is total, and we can find the function $f(x,y)$ that satisfies the given partial derivatives. The final function is $f(x,y) = (x^2 + 1/x)y + C$, where $C$ is a constant."

        "answer": "The question asks us to prove the inequality $\\cos(x) \\geq 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The given answer shows that it is enough to prove that a certain function $f(x) = \\cos(x) - 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x^2$ is non-negative for all $x \\geq 0$. This is because $f$ is an even function, and so if $f(x) \\geq 0$ for $x \\geq 0$, then $f(-x) \\geq 0$ for $x \\geq 0$ as well (since $f$ is even), which means $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nTo show that $f(x) \\geq 0$ for $x \\geq 0$, the answer uses the fact that $f(0) = 0$ and the theorem of mean value (or mean value theorem) to show that $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 0$. This means that $f$ is non-decreasing on the interval $(0, \\infty)$, and combined with the fact that $f(0) = 0$, it implies that $f(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x \\geq 0$.\n\nThere are two ways presented to show that $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for $x > 0$. The first way uses the inequality $\\sin(x) \\leq x$ for all $x \\geq 0$ to directly show that $f'(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 0$. The second way uses the fact that $f''(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x > 0$, which is shown by computing $f''(x)$ and using the fact that $\\cos(x) \\in [-1,1]$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The second way requires an additional computation of the second derivative, but has the advantage of using the fact that $f''(x) \\geq 0$, which is a stronger property than $f'(x) \\geq 0$ and can be useful in other contexts."

I have already scheduled time off of my current job to take the first interview (I didn't tell my current employer it's for an interview, just that I need time off), but I just got notice of the second. Would it be acceptable to ask for an additional day off so that I don't have to make two plane flights? Additionally, I know the first company (who I've already scheduled with) moves very quickly, and, if I pass, I would expect to have the offer a couple days later; waiting even a week for the second company could skewer my chances with the first company (the second company moves much slower, although I can push them to move quickly).\n\nA compounding factor to this is that I've been sick all week and been working from home. I've had periodic calls with my boss and he knows I'm sick (I have a cough now), so whether I'm sick or slacking is not in question (as far as I know).

You will be putting a lot of effort into the cakes and like @Joe said, the straws can be useless if crushed or deflected. If you want to use the straws so that the wooden skewer doesn't touch the cake, you can always use the straws and then insert them with the woden skewers for additional support. Straws and skewers are both easy to cut as well, so there's not much of a difference there either. There are heaps of videos and articles online and you can always ask your local cake shop for more tips and tricks.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is to use dense cakes like mud cakes to use for stacked cakes, otherwise your tiers will collapse. And please give ganaching a good thought as well. Even though there is extra cozt, effort and time involved, ganaching will make the cakes a bit tougher as the chocolate should harden once set and give very beautiful sharp edges when you fondant."

        "answer": "Rewritten question: Which of the following statements about the interpolation formula are true? Multiple answers are possible.\n\nAnswer: The true statements are a), c), and d).\n\nExplanation: \n\na) The interpolation formula is used to reconstruct a continuous signal from its sampled values. This is achieved by computing a weighted sum of the sampled values, where the weights are given by the sinc function. Therefore, statement a) is true.\n\nc) The sinc function has zeros at integer multiples of the sampling interval $T_e$. This means that if the time instant $t$ coincides with any of these zeros, then the corresponding term in the sum will be zero, and the reconstructed signal will match the sampled signal exactly at that instant. Therefore, statement c) is true.\n\nd) The interpolation formula assumes that the sampled signal is band-limited, i.e., its spectrum is zero outside a certain frequency range. This is necessary to avoid aliasing, which can occur if the sampling rate is too low relative to the signal bandwidth. Therefore, statement d) is true.\n\nb) The statement b) is false. The interpolation formula does not guarantee perfect reconstruction of the original continuous signal, even if the sampled signal is band-limited. This is because the sinc function decays slowly and its tails can introduce artifacts in the reconstructed signal. However, the reconstruction error can be reduced by using a higher sampling rate or a different interpolation method."

This is not because it violates MVC by default, but because I found that the \"natural\" way (at least for me) is different. \n\nWhen I face complex HTML markup that relates to purely view concerns, I usually write an extension method for `HtmlHelper` class in order to hide the complexity. Thus I have extensions like `Html.MoneyTextBox()`, `Html.OptionGroup()` and `Html.Pager<T>`. \n\nIn other cases when complex conditions arise, usually I missed something from the controller. For example, all issues related to the visibility, readonly or enabled of elements usually stem from something that the controller can provide. In that case instead of passing the model to the view, I create a view model which encapsulates the model and the additional info that the controller can provide in order to simplify the HTML markup. A typical example of view model is the following:\n\n```\npublic class CustomerInfo\n{\n  public Customer Customer { get; set; }\n  public bool IsEditable { get; set; }  // e.g. based on current user/role\n  public bool NeedFullAddress { get; set; }  // e.g. based on requested action \n  public bool IsEligibleForSomething { get; set; }  // e.g. based on business rule\n} \n\n```\n\nThat said, the code behind is part of the view, so you can use it freely, if it fits your needs better."

These words are not part of the vocabulary of the document collection.

Given that there are 800 sculptures not on display, applying the third statement yields that two-thirds of the pieces not on display equals 800, resulting in a not on display count of 1200.

However an opportunity has arisen to put in some new practises on a new team and so I thought I'd take a look at DVCSs to see if it's worth making the jump.\n\nThe company I work for is a pretty standard company where we all work in the same location (or sometimes at home) and we want to keep a central store of all code.\n\nMy question is: if all you are doing with a DVCS is creating a central hub that everyone pushes their changes to, is there really any benefit to moving to a DVCS and its extra overheads in this sort of environment?",
        "answer": "Personally, I find it's a huge benefit. Even with a central repo, a DVCS changes the flow from \"edit code, update from central, commit\" to \"edit code, commit, push to central\". Among other things, that means that conflict resolution is far less stressful. It can also encourage development in smaller chunks, since you don't have to push after every commit. If your team is OK with it, that means your individual commits might leave the app in a strange state, as long as it's working when you finally push to the central repo. If they're not OK with that, as long as you're using `git` (or [patch queues](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension) for `hg`, IIRC), you can still do dev in the same style, but then condense all your smaller commits into one larger commit that is complete before you push it to the central repo."

Delay\u2013Doppler images of Saturn's rings](https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1TTm.jpg)",
        "answer": "The main issue is that there is relatively little material in Saturn's atmosphere that can *efficiently* scatter radar waves, so the radar basically just gets absorbed.\n\nThe key point is that it's *much* harder to get a radar return from the very small objects (aerosol droplets or tiny ice particles) that would make up clouds in Saturn's upper atmosphere than it is to detect the meter-sized ice chunks in the rings.\n\nThe figure below (from [here](http://www.rfcafe.com/references/electrical/ew-radar-handbook/radar-cross-section.htm)) shows $\\sigma / (\\pi r^{2})$, which is the \"effective\" scattering cross section relative to the geometric cross section of a scattering object, plotted versus the size of the object $r$ relative to the wavelength of light $\\lambda$ (e.g., the radio waves used in radar). When the size of the object is roughly the same size as wavelength of light, or larger, it efficiently scatters them: its effective cross section is roughly the same as its geometric cross section (ignoring other effects such as chemical composition, surface roughness, etc.). Sometimes it can even be several times larger!\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHh0u.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHh0u.gif)\n\nBut when the objects become smaller than the wavelength, you transition to the Rayleigh scattering regime, where the scattering depends on the size of the object *to the sixth power*.\n\nImagine a sphere 10 cm in radius, roughly the same as typical radar wavelengths (so $2 \\pi r / \\lambda \\sim 1$). It will have an effective cross section similar to its geometric cross section: about 300 cm$^2$. Now imagine subdividing that object into spheres one-tenth the radius. This would mean about 1000 objects 1 cm in radius (so that the total volume is the same), with a total geometric cross section of about 3000 cm$^2$ (realistically a little less, because of shadowing). But the plot shows that the *effective* cross section goes down by a factor of 1000, so the total radar cross section of all the small objects -- and thus the backscattered energy of the radar waves -- would be ten times *smaller* than it was for the single big object of the same total volume. And that's just for a reduction in size of ten; in reality, we're talking about going from centimeter-to-meter-sized objects (the ring) to sub-mm and micron-sized cloud particles in Saturn's atmosphere.\n\nThis is why weather radar on Earth can show you *precipitation* (rain, snow, hail) -- because the raindrops/etc. are large (a few mm in size), and can scatter radar waves with some efficiency -- but usually can't show you *clouds* -- because the water droplets making up clouds are so small. (And obviously radar wouldn't be nearly as useful to the military if it was easily scattered by clouds.)\n\nSo -- absent floating chunks of centimeter- or large-sized ice in the upper atmosphere of Saturn -- you're not going to get much of a radar return from Saturn itself. The original discovery of radar returns from the rings surprised people, because the assumption had been that the rings were made up of very *small* (e.g., *micron*-sized) bits of ice, which wouldn't efficiently reflect radar waves either."

        "question": "Suppose I have a multi-threaded application (say ~40 threads) running on a multiprocessor system (say 8 cores) with Linux as the operating system where different threads are more essentially LWP (Light Weight Processes) being scheduled by the kernel.\n\nWhat would be benefits/drawbacks of using the CPU affinity? Whether CPU affinity is going to help by localizing the threads to a subset of cores thus minimizing cache sharing/misses?",
        "answer": "If you use strict affinity, then a particular thread MUST run on that processor (or set of processors). If you have many threads that work completely independently, and they work on larger chunks of memory than a few kilobytes, then it's unlikely you'll benefit much from running on one particular core - since it's quite possible the other threads running on this particular CPU would have thrown out any L1 cache, and quite possibly L2 caches too. Which is more important for performance - cahce content or \"getting to run sooner\"? Are some CPU's always idle, or is the CPU load 100% on every core? \n\nHowever, only you know (until you tell us) what your threads are doing. How big is the \"working set\" (how much memory - code and data) are they touching each time they get to run? How long does each thread run when they are running? What is the interaction with other threads? Are other threads using shared data with \"this\" thread? How much and what is the pattern of sharing? \n\nFinally, the ultimate answer is \"What makes it run faster?\" - an answer you can only find by having good (realistic) benchmarks and trying the different possible options. Even if you give us every single line of code, running time measurements for each thread, etc, etc, we could only make more or less sophisticated guesses - until these have been tried and tested (with VARYING usage patterns), it's almost impossible to know. \n\nIn general, I'd suggest that having many threads either suggest that each thread isn't very busy (CPU-wise), or you are \"doing it wrong\"... More threads aren't better if they are all running flat out - better to have fewer threads in that case, because they are just going to fight each other."

Since we are using 3-grams, we can break down \"bubble\" into \"bub\", \"ubb\", \"bbl\", \"ble\", and calculate the probability of each 3-gram occurring in language L using the given probabilities. \n\nFor \"bub\", we use the probability of \"bub|L\", which is 0.02, since it is the probability of \"bub\" given language L.

For \"bbl\", we use the probability of \"e|bbl,L\", which is 0.008, since it is the probability of \"e\" given \"bbl\" and language L. For \"ble\", we use the probability of \"e|bl,L\", which is 0.005, since it is the probability of \"e\" given \"bl\" and language L. \n\nThen, we multiply all these probabilities together to get the likelihood of \"bubble\" belonging to language L, which is:\n\n0.02 * 0.0001 * 0.008 * 0.005 = 2 * 4 * 3 * 5 * 10^-11 = 2 * 4 * 3 * 5 / 10^11 = 120 / 10^11 = 1.2 * 10^-9\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"\\\\( 2\\xa0\\\\times\\xa04\\xa0\\\\times 3\\xa0\\\\times 5\\xa0\\\\times 10^{-11}\\xa0 \\\\)\", which simplifies to \"1.2 * 10^-9\"."

        "answer": "Sometimes, the answer choices for a given question provide a helpful indication of how to approach the problem. In this case, the problem can be solved through a process of elimination using simple arithmetic. The problem states that x and y are integers, and |x-y| = 10. The question asks for the minimum possible value of (x)(y). Since all of the answer choices are negative, one of the variables must be negative and the other must be positive. Therefore, we can restrict our work to those options. By testing various values of x and y, we find that the minimum value of xy is -25 when x = 5 and y = -5. Further work is not necessary, as xy will start to increase as x continues to decrease down to 1. Therefore, the final answer is -25."

Network A has depth $3L$ and width $H$, network B has depth $L$ and width $2H$. Everything else is identical for the two networks and both $L$ and $H$ are large. In this case, performing a single iteration of backpropagation requires fewer scalar multiplications for network A than for network B.True, False,",
        "answer": "The statement is true. The number of scalar multiplications required for backpropagation is determined by the number of parameters and the operations involved in the forward and backward passes. The number of parameters in both networks is the same since they have the same width for all layers, inputs, and outputs. However, the depth and width are different for the two networks.\n\nFor network A, which has a depth of $3L$ and width of $H$, the total number of scalar multiplications required for backpropagation is given by $3LH^2$ since there are three times as many layers as network B.\n\nFor network B, which has a depth of $L$ and width of $2H$, the total number of scalar multiplications required for backpropagation is given by $L(2H)^2$.\n\nWe can simplify these expressions to get $3LH^2 < 4LH^2$.

        "question": "In class, we saw Karger's beautiful randomized algorithm for finding a min-cut in an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n = |V|$ vertices. Each iteration of Karger's algorithm can be implemented in time $O(n^2)$, and if repeated $\\Theta(n^2 \\log n)$ times, Karger's algorithm returns a min-cut with probability at least $1-1/n$. However, this leads to the often prohibitively large running time of $O(n^4 \\log n)$. Karger and Stein made a crucial observation that allowed them to obtain a much faster algorithm for min-cut: the Karger-Stein algorithm runs in time $O(n^2 \\log^3 n)$ and finds a min-cut with probability at least $1-1/n$. Explain in a couple of sentences the main idea that allowed Karger and Stein to modify Karger's algorithm into the much faster Karger-Stein algorithm. In other words, what are the main differences between the two algorithms?",
        "answer": "Karger and Stein modified Karger's algorithm for finding a min-cut in an undirected graph by observing that the probability of contracting an edge in a fixed min-cut is much lower in the initial contractions than at the end. To take advantage of this observation, they performed contractions to reduce the size of the graph from $n$ to $n/\\sqrt{2}$, making $n-n/\\sqrt{2}$ contractions. Then they found a min-cut recursively in the smaller graph by repeating the same algorithm twice on the smaller graph and choosing the smaller of the obtained cuts. The recursive calls also split and so on. This approach allowed Karger and Stein to obtain a much faster algorithm with a running time of $O(n^2 \\log^3 n)$ and a probability of finding a min-cut of at least $1-1/n$. This is in contrast to Karger's algorithm, which required $\\Theta(n^2 \\log n)$ iterations to achieve the same success probability, resulting in a much larger running time of $O(n^4 \\log n)$."

        "answer": "The function that transforms degrees Delisle to degrees Celsius is:\n$$T[^\\circ C]= 100-\\frac{2}{3}\\ T[^\\circ Delisle]$$\n\nTo understand this function, we need to know that the freezing point of water on the Celsius scale is 0\u00b0C, while on the Delisle scale it is 150\u00b0 Delisle. Therefore, we need to subtract 150 from the Delisle temperature to find the difference between the Delisle freezing point and the Celsius freezing point. \n\nNext, we need to know that the Delisle scale has its zero point at the boiling point of water, while the Celsius scale has its zero point at the freezing point of water. Therefore, we need to convert the Delisle temperature to its equivalent Celsius temperature, which is the temperature difference between the Delisle boiling point and the Celsius freezing point.\n\nTo do this conversion, we use the formula for converting between Celsius and Delisle scales, which is:\n$$T[^\\circ C]=\\frac{100-T[^\\circ Delisle]}{1.5}$$\n\nThis formula gives us the Celsius temperature equivalent to a Delisle temperature.

To do this, we can rearrange the formula as follows:\n$$T[^\\circ C]=100-\\frac{2}{3}\\ T[^\\circ Delisle]$$\n\nThis function gives us the Celsius temperature equivalent to a Delisle temperature, and it is derived from the conversion formula between the two scales."

Sample person $i$ with probability $\\frac{w_i}{W}$ and output $W$  if $i$ prefers fondue and $0$  otherwise. \\item[Estimator $\\Alg_2$:] Sample person $i$ with probability $\\frac{1}{|U|}$ and output $|U| \\cdot w_i$  if $i$ prefers fondue and $0$  otherwise. \\end{description} Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the random outputs of $\\Alg_1$ and $\\Alg_2$, respectively. Ueli has shown that $\\Alg_1$ and $\\Alg_2$ are unbiased estimators and he has also bounded their variances: \\begin{align*} \\E[X_1] = \\E[X_2] = W_F, \\qquad \\Var[X_1]  \\leq   W^2  \\qquad \\mbox{and} \\qquad \\Var[X_2]  \\leq  |U| \\sum_{i\\in U} w_i^2\\,. \\end{align*} However, Ueli is now stuck because the variances are too high to give any good guarantees for the two estimators. We are  therefore going to help Ueli by designing a new estimator with good guarantees while still asking the preferences of relatively few persons. For a fixed small parameter $\\epsilon >0$, your task is to design and analyze an estimator that outputs a random value $Y$ with the following guarantee: \\begin{align} \\label{eq:guarantee} \\Pr[|Y - W_F| \\geq \\epsilon W] \\leq 1/3\\,. \\end{align} Your estimator should ask at most $3/\\epsilon^2$ persons about their preferences.  \\\\ {\\em (In this problem you are asked to (i) design an estimator that asks  at most $3/\\epsilon^2$ persons about their preferences and (ii) prove that it satisfies the guarantee~\\eqref{eq:guarantee}. Recall that you are allowed to refer to material covered in the lecture notes.)}",
        "answer": "We are given a problem where we need to estimate the total cheese consumption of those persons that prefer fondue over raclette in Switzerland. We are given two estimators, $\\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\\mathcal{A}_2$, but their variances are too high to give good guarantees. Our task is to design an estimator that asks at most $3/\\epsilon^2$ persons about their preferences and outputs a random value $Y$ with the guarantee $\\Pr[|Y-W_F|\\geq \\epsilon W]\\leq 1/3$, where $W_F$ is the total cheese consumption of those persons that prefer fondue over raclette, $W$ is the total cheese consumption of all persons in Switzerland, and $\\epsilon>0$ is a small parameter.\n\nWe define our estimator as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Let $t=3/\\epsilon^2$.\n    \\item Run $t$ independent copies of $\\mathcal{A}_1$ to obtain estimates $Z_1,Z_2,\\ldots,Z_t$.\n    \\item Output $Y=(Z_1+Z_2+\\ldots+Z_t)/t$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSince $\\mathcal{A}_1$ only asks one person, our estimator only asks at most $3/\\epsilon^2$ persons, as required.\n\nWe now analyze the guarantee of our estimator. We have\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\E[Y]=\\E\\left[\\frac{Z_1+Z_2+\\ldots+Z_t}{t}\\right]=\\frac{1}{t}\\sum_{i=1}^t\\E[Z_i]=W_F,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere the last equality follows from that $\\mathcal{A}_1$ is an unbiased estimator which was given to us in the statement. As seen in the lecture notes, we also have\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\Var[Y]=\\frac{\\Var[Z_1]}{t},\n\\end{align*}\nand so, by the problem statement, we know $\\Var[Y]\\leq W^2/t$. We now apply Chebyshev's inequality to analyze the guarantee of our estimator:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\Pr[|Y-W_F|\\geq \\epsilon W]\\leq \\frac{\\Var[Y]}{\\epsilon^2 W^2}\\leq \\frac{W^2}{t\\epsilon^2 W^2}\\leq \\frac{1}{3},\n\\end{align*}\nwhere the last inequality is due to the choice of $t=3/\\epsilon^2$.\n\nTherefore, our estimator satisfies the desired guarantee."

        "answer": "Jeanne's algorithm is designed to calculate the sum of the first n elements of a list that contains multiples of either 5 or 7. However, there is a flaw in her algorithm that results in an incorrect output. The problem occurs when i = 1 and j = 5. At this point, the algorithm adds 5 to s and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop with i = 2. But since the value of j has not been updated, the algorithm does not enter the \"While\" loop and adds 5 to s again, and so on. As a result, the output of the algorithm is s = 5n, which is not the desired result.\n\nTo fix this problem, Jeanne needs to update the value of j after updating s, as follows:\n\n1. Set s and j to 0.\n\n2. Start a loop that iterates from i = 1 to n.\n\n3. Within the loop, use a \"while\" loop to find the next multiple of 5 or 7, and add it to s.\n\n4. After updating s, increment j by 1 to find the next multiple.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the loop is complete.\n\n6. Output the final value of s.\n\nWith this correction, the algorithm will correctly calculate the sum of the first n elements of the list containing multiples of either 5 or 7."

        "answer": "The answer to the question is that the SGD trajectory corresponding parts in the two cases are identical. This means that the optimization paths followed by the two smaller recommendation systems ($(W_A, Z_1)$ and $(W_B, Z_2)$) are the same as that of the larger system $(W, Z)$. \n\nThe reason behind this is that the objective function is separable with respect to the genre of movies and the group of users. This means that the optimization problem can be decomposed into two smaller problems, one for each genre of movies and one for each group of users. Since group 1 users only rate genre A movies and group 2 users only rate genre B movies, the two smaller systems are independent of each other. Therefore, the optimization paths followed by the two smaller systems will be the same as that of the larger system.\n\nIn other words, the objective function can be written as the sum of two independent objectives, one for genre A and one for genre B:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{(d,n)\\in\\Omega_A} [x_{dn} - (\\mathbf{W_A} \\mathbf{Z_1}^T)_{dn}]^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_w}{2} \\|\\mathbf{W_A}\\|_{Frob}^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_z}{2} \\|\\mathbf{Z_1}\\|_{Frob}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{(d,n)\\in\\Omega_B} [x_{dn} - (\\mathbf{W_B} \\mathbf{Z_2}^T)_{dn}]^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_w}{2} \\|\\mathbf{W_B}\\|_{Frob}^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_z}{2} \\|\\mathbf{Z_2}\\|_{Frob}^2$$\n\nSince the two smaller systems are independent of each other, the optimization paths followed by each system will be the same as that of the larger system. Therefore, the SGD trajectory corresponding parts in the two cases are identical."

Each rectangle is represented by its lower left corner $(x_1,y_1)$$(x_1,y_1)$ and its upper right corner $(x_2,y_2)$$(x_2,y_2)$. All coordinates are of type Long. We require $x_1 \\le x_2$$x_1 \\le x_2$ and $y_1 \\le y_2$$y_1 \\le y_2$. Define an operation hull2 that takes two Rectangles, r1 and r2, and computes as the result the smallest Rectangle containing both r1 and r2.",
        "answer": "The given code defines a function named \"hull2\" which takes two rectangle objects as input and returns a new rectangle object that is the smallest rectangle that contains both the input rectangles.\n\nThe function first extracts the lower left and upper right corner coordinates of both the input rectangles and stores them in \"r1.lowerLeft\", \"r1.upperRight\", \"r2.lowerLeft\", and \"r2.upperRight\" respectively.\n\nThen, the function calculates the new lower left corner coordinate of the resulting rectangle by taking the minimum of the x-coordinates of the lower left corners of both input rectangles and the minimum of the y-coordinates of the lower left corners of both input rectangles. This ensures that the new rectangle will have the smallest possible lower left corner that covers both input rectangles.\n\nSimilarly, the function calculates the new upper right corner coordinate of the resulting rectangle by taking the maximum of the x-coordinates of the upper right corners of both input rectangles and the maximum of the y-coordinates of the upper right corners of both input rectangles. This ensures that the new rectangle will have the largest possible upper right corner that covers both input rectangles.\n\nFinally, the function creates a new rectangle object using the calculated lower left and upper right corner coordinates and returns it as the result.\n\nIn summary, the given code calculates the smallest rectangle that covers both input rectangles by finding the minimum and maximum coordinates of their lower left and upper right corners, respectively."

You want it to get some user input, then report back what that user input IS. In your original example you tried to save it to a variable, but since variables inside functions don't have global scope that's not working for you. Let's return the value instead and save it to a variable OUTSIDE the function.\n\nOnce we've done that, we can make another function accept that as a PARAMETER, and pass it the variable to work with!

        "answer": "The question asks for the amount of water contained in 1 cubic meter of air indoors, given that 1 cubic meter of air was taken from outside in winter with a temperature of 5 degrees Celsius and a relative humidity of 80%. The answer is obtained using the conservation of mass principle, which states that the amount of water remains the same, but the volume expands due to the increase in temperature, and therefore the amount of water per cubic meter of air decreases inversely with the volume. The equation used to calculate the amount of water per cubic meter of air is:\n\nm' = m_H2O / V\n\nWhere m' is the amount of water per cubic meter of air, m_H2O is the mass of water, and V is the volume of air. To obtain the value of m', the mass of water per unit volume (m_H2O / V) is divided by the density of air at the given conditions (5 degrees Celsius and 80% relative humidity), which is 1.054 g/m3. The mass of water per unit volume is obtained from the psychrometric chart or by using equations that relate temperature, relative humidity, and dew point. The result is approximately 5.34 g/m3, which is the amount of water contained in 1 cubic meter of air indoors under the given conditions."

        "answer": "The minimum number of for-loops needed to perform the optimization using gradient descent for 500 epochs is only one.

Within this for-loop, the gradient of the cost function with respect to each weight is calculated, and the weights are updated accordingly.

Multiple people develop locally\n2. Commit a few things\n3. Commit more things\n4. Push to Staging\n5. Test new code on Staging\n6. Push to Production\n\nOur staging server serves many different sites. I would like to set up the repository for each in a different folder in a user's home directory. Each repository will have a post-receive hook (ala [the Daniel Messier article](http://danielmiessler.com/study/git/#website)) that checks out the changes into the web root for that site/repository.\n\nIt's number six that is giving me trouble. \n\nWhen I try to run any git commands, I get the error \"fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree\". I get this error whether I am running 'git status' from the repository (/home/gituser/website1.git - which I don't believe should work anyway..) or from the web root (/var/www/website1). \n\nHowever, if I specify the GIT\\_DIR and GIT\\_WORK\\_TREE, then I am able to run git commands. Both of these work:\n\n```\n$ git --git-dir /home/gituser/website1.git --work-tree /var/www/website1 status\n$ GIT_DIR=/home/gituser/website1.git GIT_WORK_TREE=/var/www/website1 git status \n\n```\n\nSo I need:\n\n1.

(Note that Git commands still won't work from the work tree location, because it's not a repository.)"

        "question": "find the compound interest on $ 1200 for 6 years at 20 % p . a . if ci is component yearly ?",
        "answer": "The formula used to calculate the compound interest (CI) is a = p (1 + r/100)^t, where 'a' represents the total amount including the principal amount, 'p', the rate of interest per annum, 'r', and the time period, 't'. \n\nUsing this formula, when the principal amount, 'p', is equal to $1200, the rate of interest per annum, 'r', is 20%, and the time period, 't', is 6 years, the total amount, 'a', is calculated to be $3583. \n\nTherefore, the compound interest, 'CI', can be determined by subtracting the principal amount, 'p', from the total amount, 'a', which gives $2383. Hence, the answer is $2383."

        "answer": "The question asks for the message that the assistant sends to ensure the authenticity of a note using the RSA system. The professor requires the assistant to sign the messages confidentially using the RSA system. The public key of the assistant is (3, 15), and the public key of the professor is (7, 77).\n\nTo answer the question, we need to find the private key of the assistant. We factorize n_A = 15 = 3*5, then solve d_A * e_A = 1 mod (p_A \u22121)(q_A \u22121), which gives d_A = 3. The signature of a message M is given by S = (M^(d_A) mod n_A)^(e_P) mod n_P.\n\nFor the note 4, we have M = 4. First, we calculate 4^(3) mod 15 = 4. Then, we calculate S = 4^(7) mod 77 = 60. Therefore, the message sent by the assistant is 60,60.\n\nNote that the message and the signature are the same because 4^(3) = 4 mod 15. However, in practice, it is not necessary to send both the message and the signature. The signature alone proves that the assistant sent the note and that the note is authentic. But in some cases, it may be necessary to send both the message and the signature, such as when the assistant has published the note elsewhere and needs to prove that they were the author of the note.\n\nIt is also important to note that in reality, the signature is not applied directly to the message itself but to a hash of the message. In this case, it would be necessary to send both the message and the signature. For more information on the differences between decryption and signing, see \"RSA Signing is Not RSA Decryption\" by Cornell University."

The first statement says that if a sequence can be bounded by two constants, one for even terms and one for odd terms, then the sequence is bounded above and therefore has a maximum value. The second statement says that if each term of a sequence is greater than or equal to the negation of a positive constant, then the sequence is bounded below and therefore has a minimum value. The third statement is false because being bounded above does not necessarily imply that there exists a specific constant such that each term is less than one fifth of that constant. The fourth statement says that if a sequence is bounded, then there exists a range of values between two positive constants that contains all the terms of the sequence. The fifth statement says that if a sequence is bounded, then there exists a range of values between a negative constant and a positive constant that contains all the terms of the sequence."

        "answer": "Reservation stations are typically found in dynamically scheduled out-of-order processors. This means that the processor is capable of reordering instructions to optimize performance, and the reservation stations play a key role in facilitating this process. By allowing instructions to be held temporarily and executed out of order, reservation stations help to prevent pipeline stalls and ensure that the processor is always operating at maximum efficiency. Overall, the use of reservation stations is one of the key features that distinguishes high-performance modern processors from their more basic counterparts."

Give an example that shows that the factor $2$ is tight in the above bound. The simplest such example only uses two experts, i.e., $N=2$, and each of the experts is wrong roughly half of the time. Finally, note how your example motivates the use of a random strategy (as in the Hedge strategy that we will see in the next lecture).",
        "answer": "The question asks for an example that shows the factor $2$ in the upper bound for the number of mistakes made by the Weighted Majority algorithm is tight. The answer provides such an example with two experts and a deterministic implementation of the algorithm that always follows the expert who made fewer mistakes in the past. The example consists of identical phases, each consisting of two days. In the first day of each phase, the algorithm follows the first expert, who is wrong, and in the second day, it follows the second expert, who is also wrong. In total, the algorithm makes two mistakes in each phase, while each expert makes only one mistake. Therefore, the factor $2$ in the upper bound is tight in this example.\n\nThe answer also notes that this example motivates the use of a random strategy, such as the Hedge strategy that will be discussed in the next lecture. With a random strategy, the algorithm can avoid always following the same expert and getting stuck in a pattern where it always makes two mistakes in each phase. Instead, the algorithm can randomly choose which expert to follow in each round, which can lead to a more balanced distribution of mistakes across the experts and potentially fewer mistakes overall."

        "answer": "The LP-rounding algorithm for Set Cover works by solving the LP relaxation of the problem and returning the solution containing all sets with a positive value in the fractional solution. We want to prove that this algorithm is an $f$-approximation algorithm, where $f$ is the maximum number of sets that any element belongs to.\n\nTo prove this, we first consider an optimal dual solution $y$. By complementary slackness, for each set $S$, either $x^*_S = 0$ or $\\sum_{e\\in S} y_e = c(S)$. This means that the dual variable $y_e$ represents the cost of covering element $e$ in the optimal solution. \n\nNext, we compute the cost of the LP-rounding algorithm. The cost of the algorithm is the sum of the costs of all sets that are included in the solution. By complementary slackness, we can rewrite this as $\\sum_{S:x^*_S > 0} c(S) = \\sum_{S:x^*_S > 0} \\sum_{e\\in S} y_e$, which is the sum of the costs of all elements that are covered in the solution.\n\nUsing the fact that $y$ is a feasible dual solution, we can bound the cost of the algorithm as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{S:x^*_S > 0} c(S) &= \\sum_{S:x^*_S > 0} \\sum_{e\\in S} y_e \\\\\n&\\leq \\sum_{S} \\sum_{e\\in S} y_e && \\text{since only non-negative terms are removed} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{e \\in U} y_e \\sum_{S \\ni e} 1 && \\text{grouping by element} \\\\\n&\\leq \\sum_{e\\in U} f\\cdot y_e && \\text{since each element is in at most $f$ sets} \\\\\n&\\leq f\\cdot OPT && \\text{since } \\sum_{e\\in U} y_e \\leq OPT.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the cost of the LP-rounding algorithm is at most $f\\cdot OPT$, which proves that the algorithm is an $f$-approximation algorithm."

        "answer": "The expression \"subst0(e, \"x\", N(\"y\"))\" means substituting all occurrences of \"x\" in the expression \"e\" with the expression \"N(\"y\")\". \n\nThe expression \"e\" is a function call where the function being called is \"N(\"exists\")\" and the argument being passed is another function call. This inner function call has a function \"N(\"less\")\" being called with two arguments - \"N(\"x\")\" and a variable \"y\". This entire expression is wrapped inside another function \"Fun(\"y\", ...)\".\n\nNow, when we apply \"subst0(e, \"x\", N(\"y\"))\", we are replacing all occurrences of \"x\" with \"N(\"y\")\".

Since, I think that GIS & Telecommunication is broad subject, I think GIS SE is the correct platform to ask these questions:\n\n1. What are the uses of GIS in telecom?\n2. How to use GIS for telecom?\n3. Is there any free study and test material? There are a lot of them but none are free :( .",
        "answer": "There are lots of different areas of Telco. I'd suggest looking into [Fiber-to-the-Home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-to-the-home) (FTTH). If you're in the US, [stimulus funding](http://www.lightwaveonline.com/fttx/news/Fiber-dominates-latest-US-rural-broadband-stimulus-funds-release-82618867.html) for deploying fiber to rural areas makes this an attractive area. (This sure looks better than LightSquared plan which [interferes with GPS reception](http://www.insidegnss.com/node/2779).)\n\nThe relational database designs for modeling fiber connectivity I've seen are quite complex. Keeping track of [splices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber#Termination_and_splicing) is especially challenging.

Upon requesting a payment, a process TO-broadcasts a message [PAY, source, recipient, amount]. Upon TO-delivering a message [PAY, source, recipient, amount], a process verifies if balance[source] is at least amount. If so, it subtracts amount from balance[source] and adds it to balance[recipient].\nSince every process receives the same sequence of operations, the outcome of each operation is the same at every process. Correct processes successfully issue operations and agree on the balance of every process at any point in time."

        "question": "Consider an IR system using a Vector Space model with Okapi BM25 as the weighting scheme (with \\(k=1.5\\) and \\(b=0.75\\)) and operating on a document collection that contains:a document \\(d_1\\), andand a document \\(d_3\\) corresponding to the concatenation of 3 copies of \\(d_1\\).Indicate which of the following statements are true, where \\(\\langle d\\rangle\\) stands for the vector representing document \\(d\\):(Penalty for wrong ticks.)The cosine similarity between \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\) is equal to 1., Each component of \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) is strictly larger than the corresponding one in \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\)., Each component of \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) is strictly smaller than the corresponding one in \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\)., Indexing terms with small term frequency are favored in \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) (w.r.t. \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\))., Indexing terms with large term frequency are favored in \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) (w.r.t. \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\)).,",
        "answer": "The correct answer is: 'Each component of \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) is strictly larger than the corresponding one in \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\).'\n\nExplanation: \nIn the Okapi BM25 weighting scheme, the weight of each term in a document is determined by its frequency in the document and its frequency in the collection. The formula for calculating the weight of a term in a document is as follows:\n\n\\(w_{t,d} = \\frac{(k+1)tf_{t,d}}{k((1-b) + b\\frac{L_d}{L_{avg}}) + tf_{t,d}}\\cdot\\log{\\frac{N - n_t + 0.5}{n_t + 0.5}}\\)\n\nwhere \\(tf_{t,d}\\) is the frequency of term \\(t\\) in document \\(d\\), \\(L_d\\) is the length of document \\(d\\), \\(L_{avg}\\) is the average length of documents in the collection, \\(n_t\\) is the number of documents containing term \\(t\\), and \\(N\\) is the total number of documents in the collection.\n\nSince document \\(d_3\\) is the concatenation of 3 copies of document \\(d_1\\), its length is three times that of \\(d_1\\). Therefore, for any term that appears in both \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_3\\), its frequency in \\(d_3\\) will be three times that in \\(d_1\\). Plugging this into the formula for calculating the weight of a term in a document, we can see that the weight of each term in \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) will be larger than the corresponding one in \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\). Thus, the statement \"Each component of \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) is strictly larger than the corresponding one in \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\)\" is true.\n\nThe statement \"Indexing terms with small term frequency are favored in \\(\\langle d_3\\rangle\\) (w.r.t. \\(\\langle d_1\\rangle\\))\" is false. In fact, the opposite is true \u2013 terms with high frequency in the collection are favored in Okapi BM25. This is because the logarithmic term in the formula increases with the inverse document frequency (i.e., the number of documents containing the term), so terms that appear in many documents will have a higher weight."

        "answer": "The answer to the given question is that a compiler for a VLIW processor like Itanium would experience the same scheduling issues as a statically scheduled HLS tool like Xilinx Vivado HLS when processing the given code snippet. This is because VLIWs also use similar scheduling techniques as static HLS, and hence the behavior is qualitatively the same.\n\nTo elaborate further, both VLIW processors and static HLS tools rely on the concept of static scheduling, which involves determining the execution order of program operations at compile-time. This approach is used to optimize the performance of the resulting circuit by minimizing the number of pipeline stalls and ensuring efficient resource utilization.\n\nIn the given code snippet, the if condition involves a multiplication operation that takes several cycles to compute. As a result, the scheduling of this operation becomes critical for performance optimization. Both VLIW processors and static HLS tools would aim to minimize the latency of this operation by scheduling it appropriately and overlapping it with other computations.\n\nTherefore, the behavior of a VLIW compiler and a static HLS tool would be qualitatively the same in terms of scheduling the given code snippet efficiently. Both approaches would use similar techniques to optimize the performance of the circuit and ensure efficient resource utilization."

        "answer": "The correct answer is \"10^8 + 10^15\". However, there are three different regular expressions provided to account for different formatting preferences.\n\nTo arrive at the answer, we need to calculate the number of parameters for each model and then add them together. \n\nFor the 4-gram character model, we need to consider the number of possible combinations of 4 characters, which is the size of the character set (which we can assume to be all possible ASCII characters) raised to the power of 4. This gives us 256^4 possible combinations, or 4,294,967,296 parameters.\n\nFor the 3-gram word model, we need to consider the number of possible combinations of 3 words. Assuming a large vocabulary of 100,000 words, this gives us 100,000^3 possible combinations, or 1,000,000,000,000 parameters.\n\nAdding these together, we get 4,294,967,296 + 1,000,000,000,000 = 1.000000004295\u00d710^15.

The algorithm outputs these vertex sets.\n\nTo prove that the output satisfies the desired property, the answer uses the fact that the expected number of edges cut by a random $S_i$ is at least $|E|/2$, as shown in a previous subproblem. Therefore, the average number of edges cut by all the $S_i$ is also at least $|E|/2$, which implies that there exists at least one $S_i$ that cuts at least $|E|/2$ edges. \n\nSince the algorithm generates $\\ell$ vertex sets, it outputs at most polynomially many sets, as required. Overall, the algorithm runs in polynomial time and outputs a set of vertex subsets that cut at least half the edges in any given edge set, satisfying the problem statement."

Regular ASCII is a subset of UTF8, which is up to character at 128, extended isn't.\n\nIf you tried this, it won't work;\n\n```\niconv(\"ASCII\", \"UTF-8\", $string);\n\n```\n\nYou can try this first, because its the least invasive, looks like mysql supports cp850, so you can try this at the top of your script:\n\n```\nodbc_exec($conn, \"SET NAMES 'CP850'\");\nodbc_exec($conn, \"SET client_encoding='CP850'\");\n\n```\n\nThis might work, if your original assertion is correct:\n\n```\niconv(\"CP437\", \"UTF-8\", $string);\n\n```\n\nor this, my initial hunch, that your database is in latin-1:\n\n```\niconv(\"CP850\", \"UTF-8\", $string);\n\n```\n\nIBM CP850 has all the printable characters that ISO-8859-1(latin-1) has, its just that \u00df is at 223 in ISO-8859-1.\n\nYou can see the position of \u00df in the table on this page:\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Latin_character_sets_%28computing%29>\n\nAs a drop in replacement to your existing code, in your question, see if this works:\n\n```\n    $api->doRequest(\"http://example.de/api.html?value=\" . $iconv(\"CP850\", \"UTF-8\",$row[\"field\"])); \n    // --- 2 ---\n    $api->doRequest(\"http://example.de/api.html?value=\" . $iconv(\"CP850\", \"UTF-8\",$row[\"field\"])); \n    // --- 3 ---\n    $api->doRequest(\"http://example.de/api.html?value=\" . $iconv(\"CP850\", \"UTF-8\",$row[\"field\"])); \n\n```\n\nThis will work if your entire database is in the same encoding.\n\nIf your database isn't consistently adhering to one encoding, it might be possible that no one answer is completely right. If that is the case, you can also try the answer here, but with a different encoding:\n\n[Latin-1 / UTF-8 encoding php](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16165611/latin-1-utf-8-encoding-php)\n\n```\n// If it's not already UTF-8, convert to it\nif (mb_detect_encoding($row[\"field\"], 'utf-8', true) === false) {\n    $row[\"field\"] = mb_convert_encoding($row[\"field\"], 'utf-8', 'iso-8859-1');\n}\n\n```\n\nMy real correct answer is, if you can, **insert** the data in UTF8 correctly, so you dont have problems like this. Of course, that is not always possible.\n\nReference:\n\n[Force encode from US-ASCII to UTF-8 (iconv)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11303405/force-encode-from-us-ascii-to-utf-8-iconv)"

        "question": "I have a file \"ingredients.txt\" that has a list of 38 words (one per each line). \nI have figured out how to read it into an array\n\n```\ngetArray() {\n    array=() \n    while IFS= read -r line \n    do\n        array+=(\"$line\")\n    done < \"$1\"\n}\n\ngetArray \"ingredients.txt\"\n\n```\n\nBut now how to get output of all combinations of exactly 4 words from the list of 38?\n\nEDIT: To respond to a comment, I do mean combinations and not permutations, and repetitions are not valid. Four unique words in each combination.\n\nTo further clarify, think of it as drawing four marbles of 38 different colors from a bag. No two colors alike. Once you draw a red one, it is impossible to draw another red one for that combination. You draw four, write down the colors, and put them back in the bag, and draw another four. If you get {blue, yellow, purple, red} and {yellow, purple, red, blue} they are not counted separately. I just want combinations, not permutations.\n\nAlso, I want each combination printed (going back to the ingredients list):\nonion, cheese, meat, bun \nlettuce, carrot, celery, radish\ncarrot, lettuce, celery, vinegar\netc.\n\nI hope this is clear.",

This should not include the regularization term.\n          The inputs of the function are dataset, and the predicted labels.",
        "answer": "The given answer is a Python function that takes in three inputs: the dataset `X`, the true labels `y`, and the predicted labels `y_pred`. It computes the gradient of the binary-cross entropy loss with respect to the weights, and then averages the gradient across the whole dataset. The regularization term is not included in this calculation.\n\nInside the function, the gradient is computed using the formula `grad = -np.sum(np.einsum('ij,i->ij',X,y-y_pred),axis=0)`. Here, `np.einsum('ij,i->ij',X,y-y_pred)` represents the element-wise product of `X` and the difference between `y` and `y_pred`. This is a matrix multiplication operation that results in a matrix with the same shape as `X`. The `np.sum` function sums up all the elements of this matrix along the 0th axis, which gives us a gradient vector. Finally, the negative sign is added to match the gradient direction of the binary-cross entropy loss.\n\nThe computed gradient is then returned as the output of the function. Since the question asks for the gradient to be averaged across the whole dataset, this computation is not done within the function. It is up to the caller of the function to perform this step."

        "question": "Consider the following contains function defined on Iterable (in particular, it accepts both Vector and List).  def contains[A](l: Iterable[A], elem: A): Boolean =   val n = l.size   if n <= 5 then     for i <- l do       if i == elem then         return true     false   else     val (p0, p1) = parallel(       contains(l.take(n / 2), elem),       contains(l.drop(n / 2), elem)     )   p0 || p1 Let $n$$n$ be the size of l. Assume that drop and take run in $\\Theta(1)$$\\Theta(1)$ on Vector and $\\Theta(n)$$\\Theta(n)$ on List. What is the asymptotic depth of contains if it is called on a Vector?",
        "answer": "The given function \"contains\" takes an Iterable and an element as input and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the element is present in the Iterable or not. The function works by dividing the Iterable into two halves and recursively calling itself on each half until the size of the Iterable is less than or equal to 5. At this point, the function iterates through the remaining elements of the Iterable to find the element. If the element is found, it returns true, otherwise false.\n\nThe asymptotic depth of the \"contains\" function when called on a Vector can be determined by analyzing the recursive calls made by the function. Since the input Iterable is divided into two halves at each recursive call, the depth of the call tree can be defined recursively as $D(n) = \\max(D(n/2), D(n/2)) + O(1) = D(n/2) + O(1)$. This means that the maximum depth of the call tree is the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees plus a constant time operation. \n\nUsing the Master Theorem, we can see that the recurrence relation $D(n) = \\max(D(n/2), D(n/2)) + O(1)$ has a solution of $D(n) = \\Theta(\\log n)$. Therefore, the asymptotic depth of the \"contains\" function when called on a Vector is $\\Theta(\\log n)$. \n\nThis can be understood intuitively by realizing that at each level of recursion, the size of the Iterable is halved. Thus, the number of recursive calls required to reach an Iterable of size 1 is $\\log_2 n$, which results in a call tree of depth $\\log_2 n$."

        "answer": "The given statement implies that when A covers a distance of 200 meters, B covers a distance of 180 meters (200-20) and C covers a distance of 162 meters (200-38). Further, when C covers 162 meters, B covers 180 meters. Therefore, when B covers a distance of 600 meters, C covers 540 meters (162/180 x 600). Consequently, B beats C by a margin of 60 meters (600-540). Hence, the answer is 60 meters."

        "answer": "Well if you want to save the differences from each frame to frame only you could simply use a substraction-method. Simply substract the color values at image(t+1) from image(t)... All parts that stay equal haven't changed... only the parts that are different will result in something non-zero. You can then extract the rectangles around it and save them. But of course be aware since there might be more than one part changing of course and you probably wanna save each one instead of the big rectangle that contains all changes...\n\nYou could use OpenCV for this... it has all basic functions for image substraction, rectangle fitting, cropping, ...\n\nHope that helps..."

        "answer": "1. The function is the absolute value of $x$ multiplied by $-1$, so it is decreasing on $[-1,0]$ and increasing on $[0,1]$. The maximum value is therefore achieved at $x=0$, which is $f(0)=0$. The minimum value is achieved at the endpoints of the interval, which are $x=-1$ and $x=1$, and is equal to $f(-1)=f(1)=-1$.\n\n2. The function $\\sin(x)$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$, but the interval $]-\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\frac{\\pi}{4}]$ only contains the maximum value at $x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\n3. The function is defined piecewise. On the interval $[-1,1]$, the function is increasing and achieves its maximum value at the endpoint $x=1$, which is $f(1)=1$. On the interval $(1,3]$, the function is decreasing and achieves its minimum value at the endpoint $x=3$, which is $f(3)=2-3=-1$. There is no maximum on this interval.\n\n4. The function $\\cos(\\frac{1}{x})$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$, but it has an oscillation of increasing frequency as $x$ approaches $0$. Therefore, there is an infinite sequence of points $x_n=\\frac{1}{2n\\pi}$ where the function achieves its maximum value of $1$, and an infinite sequence of points $y_n=\\frac{1}{\\pi+2n\\pi}$ where the function achieves its minimum value of $-1$. At $x=0$, the function is undefined but the limit as $x$ approaches $0$ is $0$, so we define $f(0)=0$.\n\n5. The function $\\arctan(x)$ is increasing and unbounded on $\\mathbb{R}$, so there is no maximum or minimum value."

        "question": "Why is it that the produced clock frequency is 6.144 MHz, but internally it (8085 processor) uses only 3.072 MHz. Also what leads to the specific value of 6.144 in a clock. \n\nI found an answer at yahoo.... <http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080810090119AAurr2i>\n\nbut I must admit I didn't still get it it well. Could any of you guys throw out a few lines on this, please?",
        "answer": "One reason to divide a clock by two is to obtain an even 50% duty cycle square wave. It may be that the 8085 internally uses both clock edges, and wouldn't function if one half of the cycle happened to be much shorter than the other. \n\nIn the days when the 8085 was new, those nice canned oscillators weren't common, and people often cobbled together clock circuits out of discrete crystals, capacitors, and logic gates. Dividing by two ensures that you have equally spaced rising and falling edges.\n\nAs for 6.144MHz, you will find that it can be divided by an integer to get common baud rate values, at least up to 38400. \n\n---\n\n*follow up ...*\n---------------\n\nLooking at an Intel data sheet for the 8085, there are three interesting statements\n\n1. > \n> The 8085 incorporates all of the features that the 8224 clock generator and 8228 system controller provided for the 8080A\n> \n> \n>\n2. > \n> X1 and X2: Are connected to a crystal, LC or RC network to drive the internal clock generator. The input frequency is divided by 2 to give the processor's internal operating frequency.\n> \n> \n>\n3. > \n> CLK: Clock output for use as a system clock. The period of CLK is twice the X1, X2 input period.\n> \n> \n>\n\nSo, speculations about using the odd edges of the clock to move stuff around internally aside, it becomes apparent that when they designed the 8085, Intel was replacing the need for a special clock controller by integrating that feature into the chip. Dividing the X1-X2 timebase in half before outputting it as CLK ensures that the *system* gets a nice even duty cycle, if nothing else."

        "answer": "Rewritten answer: The precision of the fraud classifier is 50%, which means that out of all the instances classified as fraudulent, only half of them are actually fraudulent. The recall of the classifier is 66.6%, which means that out of all the instances that are actually fraudulent, the classifier is able to correctly identify two-thirds of them. \n\nExplanation: Precision and recall are two important metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classifier. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among the instances classified as positive, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all the instances that are actually positive. In this case, the fraud classifier has a precision of 50%, which means that it is only half accurate in identifying fraudulent instances. However, the classifier has a recall of 66.6%, which means that it is able to correctly identify a significant proportion of all the fraudulent instances, even though it may also classify some non-fraudulent instances as fraudulent. Overall, the performance of the classifier can be improved by optimizing for both precision and recall."

        "answer": "The statement \"Generative Adversarial Networks use the generator and discriminator models during training but only the discriminator for data synthesis\" is false. In fact, only the generator is used for data synthesis in GANs.\n\nDuring training, the generator and discriminator models are both used to improve the performance of the GAN. The generator is responsible for creating new samples that are similar to the training data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between the real data and the generated data.\n\nOnce the GAN is trained, the generator can be used to synthesize new data by simply feeding it random noise as input. The generator then produces a new sample, which can be used for various applications such as image generation or music composition.\n\nTherefore, it is incorrect to say that the discriminator is used for data synthesis in GANs. Only the generator is responsible for creating new samples."

        "answer": "The trapping wavelength is important in optical trapping because different wavelengths can cause different levels of photodamage to biological samples. Photodamage occurs when the energy from the laser light causes damage to the sample, such as by inducing oxidative stress or damaging DNA. \n\nBy using a trapping wavelength that is less likely to cause photodamage, researchers can avoid harming the sample and ensure that their experimental results are accurate. Additionally, some samples may be more sensitive to photodamage than others, so choosing the appropriate trapping wavelength can help to minimize damage while still achieving successful trapping. \n\nOverall, understanding the potential for photodamage and selecting an appropriate trapping wavelength is crucial for performing safe and effective optical trapping experiments."

        "question": "As a European citizen I am somewhat puzzled by how American credit scores work. The US is one of the few, possibly the only country where such a strong focus is put on the utilization history of personal credit (cards), to the point where people try to work out the best strategy to optimising their credit score.\n\nAs I understand it most other countries would build a credit report based on debt payment history (utilities, taxes, bills), income and the presence of any registered instances of non-payment. However, as stated in [this article](http://www.joetaxpayer.com/your-fico-score/), that's only a minor element of an American credit report:\n\n> \n> There are those (such as Dave Ramsey) who will tell you to avoid all credit cards. This is nonsense. Graduate college, get a good job, save for a house, and you\u2019ll find that without any credit history your options to get a mortgage will be limited despite the nice downpayment and low debt to income that new mortgage would cost you.\n> \n> \n> \n\nWhile I understand that this type of credit score will easily weed out true bad apples, I cannot see the advantage in this type of scoring for ranking people with no history of non-payment.\n\nWhile I can't speak for all of Europe, in my experience the majority of credit cards are never used except for online purchases or in places where debit cards are not accepted. People then generally set-up direct debit to pay off the balance automatically each month. These cards never accrue interest and likely see a limit utilization of 0-5% per month. Owning a credit card is also still not that common.\n\nIn the end, it seems to me like the credit score boils down to having a proven track record of **spending your money**. This just does not strike me as a particularly effective metric. What then are the reasons that this system is still being used? \n\n*I struggled somewhat with writing my thoughts on this down. Note that I'm not looking for a debate but want to find out how and why this system of credit scoring came about and if it is actually proven effective. I've read statements from banks that \"it does\" and I'm sure it works for non-payers but have found little about its value for the rest of us.*",
        "answer": "FICO is a financial services company, whose customers are financial services companies. Their products are for the benefit of their customers, not consumers.\n\nThe purpose of the credit score system is two-fold. First, the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions (FICO's customers) to assess the risk of loans that they make. This is probably based on science, although the FICO studies and even the FICO score formula are proprietary secrets.\n\nThe second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money. And they have done a great job of that. If you think you might need a loan in the future, perhaps a mortgage or a car loan, you need a credit score. And the only way to get a credit score is to start borrowing money now that you don't need. \n\nYes, someone with a good income and a long history of paying utility bills on time would be a great credit risk for a mortgage. However, that person will have no credit score, and therefore be declared by FICO as a bad credit risk. On the other hand, someone with a low income, who struggles, but succeeds, to make the minimum payment on their credit card, would have a better credit score. The advice offered to the first person is start borrowing money now, even though you don't need it.\n\nI'm not anti-credit card. I use a credit card responsibly, paying it off in full every month. I use it for the convenience. I don't worry at all about my credit score, but I've been told it is great. However, there are some people that cannot use a credit card responsibly. The temptation is too great. Perhaps they are like problem gamblers, I don't know. But FICO and the financial services industry have created a system that makes a credit card a necessity in many ways. These are the people that get hurt in the current system."

Solving for $\\mathbf{w}$, we get:\n$$\\mathbf{w}_{\\text{ridge}}^{\\star} = \\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X} + 2 N \\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{y}$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}$ is the data matrix with dimensions $N \\times D$, where each row is a feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_{n}$, and $\\mathbf{y}$ is the response vector with dimensions $N \\times 1$. This is the closed-form solution for the ridge regression problem. The term $2 N \\lambda \\mathbf{I}$ is added to the diagonal of $\\mathbf{X}^{\\top} \\mathbf{X}$ to ensure that the matrix is invertible. The final result is expressed in terms of the data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and the response vector $\\mathbf{y}$."

        "question": "I know how the compiler interprets the final keyword in Java, but how should us programmers interpret its meaning? Should it be:\n\n1) This variable cannot be changed (used by inner class for example)\n\nor\n\n2) I'm not planning to change this variable (**might** have some optimisation benefits for member variables).\n\nI'm asking because I've worked on code where everything is declared final by default (option 2 above) which, in my opinion, devalues the keyword and hides the values that **really** can't change! Is there still performance benefits in declaring variables final?",
        "answer": "I don't understand why you think there's lack of value.\n\nWhen I see all final variables, it implies that the class is immutable. That's a good thing, because immutable classes are inherently thread safe."

Please provide piskei halacha, and I prefer that the *shitot ha-poskim* come from reputable sources.\n\n(As always, CYLOR before you make any decisions.)",
        "answer": "Rav Belsky, on page 9 of *Shulchan Halevi* (English version), explains that while theoretically silk-screening could be kosher for writing Stam, there are some issues which can come up. He mentions that forgeries would increase, and there there could be a problem of kesidran (\"written in order,\" which Teffilin and Mezuzah require).\n\nThen he brings an issue with sirtut (line indents under the letters to help guide the sofer to keep the letters in a straight line) - that Mezuzah needs it, and even according to many shittos a sefer Torah needs it. It could be a problem according to Rabbi Akiva Eiger in *Shailos and Tshuvos* Siman 50.\n\nHe ends with the famous idea \"chadasha assur min HaTorah\" (anything new is forbidden). To revolutionize the way a mitzvah is to be performed or prepared, the initiative has to come from the Gedolei Hador, not from any single individual.\n\nIt is best to see it inside since I did not fully elaborate on the topic."

        "answer": "The given problem concerns the ratio of ducks and frogs in a pond, which is 37:39. The average of the total number of ducks and frogs in the pond is 132. Using this information, we can calculate the total number of ducks and frogs as 2 times the average, which is 262. To find the number of frogs in the pond, we can use the ratio of ducks to frogs and the total number of ducks and frogs. By using the formula (total number of frogs = (total number of ducks and frogs * ratio of frogs)/(ratio of ducks + ratio of frogs)), we obtain the answer as 134. Therefore, the formal solution to the problem is that there are 134 frogs in the pond."

The second series converges by the comparison test, by comparing it to the convergent geometric series $\\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{1}{2^n}$. The third series converges by comparison to the convergent series $\\sum_{n\\geq 0}\\frac{1}{n^{3}}$. The fourth series converges by comparison to the convergent series $\\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{1}{n^3}$.

        "answer": "The maximum number of parameters the probabilistic model needs to consider is given by the sum of the parameters required for lexical conditioning and syntactic dependencies. \n\nFor limited lexical conditioning, the model needs to consider the probability of each word being assigned each of the {t} PoS tags, which gives {t} parameters per word. Since there are {w} words in the sequence, the total number of parameters required for lexical conditioning is {t * w}.\n\nFor limited scope of syntactic dependencies, the model needs to consider the probability of each PoS tag being assigned to each position in the sequence given the PoS tag assigned to its neighbor. Since there are {w} positions in the sequence, and each position has at most two neighbors, the total number of parameters required for syntactic dependencies is {t * (1 + t) * (w - 1)}. However, since the first and last positions have only one neighbor, we need to subtract {t} from the total number of parameters. This gives a final total of {t * (1 + t) * (w - 1) - t}.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of parameters the probabilistic model needs to consider is {t * w + t * (1 + t) * (w - 1) - t}, which simplifies to {t * (1 + t + w - 1) + (w - 1) * t * (t - 1)}, which can be further simplified to the two expressions given as the correct answer: {t * (1 + t + w)} and {t * (t - 1) + t + w * t - t}."

The given answer provides an example of the Huffman code for each letter, with the number of appearances and the corresponding code word. \n\nFor instance, the letter \"A\" appears 5 times and is assigned the code word \"1\". The letter \"V\" appears 2 times and is assigned the code word \"011\". The letter \"D\" and \"K\" appear 2 and 1 times respectively, and are assigned the code words \"010\" and \"001\". The letters \"E\" and \"R\" both appear once, and are assigned the code words \"0001\" and \"0000\" respectively.\n\nUsing this code, the entire sequence \"AVADA KEDAVRA\" would be represented by a string of 28 bits. It's worth noting that different Huffman trees can be constructed, resulting in different code words for each letter. However, the length of the encoded sequence remains constant at 28 bits in this case."

        "answer": "The parameter that relates evaporation rate to temperature and pressure is called vapor pressure of the evaporant. The formula to compute the evaporation flux according to the vapor pressure of the evaporant is given in the slides about vapor creation. The boiling point of the evaporant is relevant information when the material is at atmospheric pressure. The mean free path inside the evaporation chamber modifies the way atoms condensate on the substrate. However, the maximum evaporation rate is independent of the condensation rate; evaporation occurs before condensation."

So here I have events and the handling of events. \n\nThey work after I define them in `Providers\\EventServiceProvider.php`\n\n```\nprotected $listen = [\n    UserHasSignedUp::class => [\n        SendWelcomeEmail::class,\n        SendAdminEmail::class\n    ]\n];\n\n```\n\nSo what are **Listeners**?\n\nTo me they seem exactly the same thing as **Event Handlers**?",
        "answer": "In your example `UserHasSignedUp` is an `Event`. `SendWelcomeEmail` and `SendAdminEmail` are two listeners \"waiting\" for the event UserHasSignedUp to be fired and they should implement the required business logic at `handle` method of each one.\n\nSuper simple example:\n\nSomewhere in UserController\n\n```\nEvent::fire(new UserHasSignedUp($user)); //UserHasSignedUp is the event being fired\n\n```\n\nSendWelcomeEmail class\n\n```\nclass SendWelcomeEmail //this is the listener class\n{\n    public function handle(UserHasSignedUp $event) //this is the \"handler method\"\n    {\n        //send an email\n    }   \n}\n\n```\n\nAs you can see, each event can have multiple listeners, but a listener can't listen to more than a single event.\nIf you want a class listening to many events, you should take a look to [Event Subscribers](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/events#event-subscribers)\n\nHope it helps."

        "question": "In class, we studied extensively the coloring problem of random regular graphs. In this exercise, we will consider a variant of the problem called circular coloring, still on random regular graphs of degree d. The color-variables si on the nodes of the graph can take one of q colors, si \u2208 {1, . . . , q}. The rule of circular coloring is that the two nodes of each edge can take two consecutive colors modulo q. For instance, for q = 4 only the following color combinations are allowed for a given edge {(1, 2),(2, 3),(3, 4),(4, 1)} (in contrast with the normal graph coloring pairs (1, 3) and (2, 4) are not allowed for circular coloring). A graph is considered circular q-colorable if and only if there is an assignment of colors to nodes such that each edge is in the allowed list. Write the belief propagation equations for generic q and d.",
        "answer": "The task is to write the belief propagation equations for the circular coloring problem on random regular graphs of degree d and q colors. The goal is to find an assignment of colors to nodes such that each edge is in the allowed list.\n\nThe belief propagation equations for circular coloring are similar to those for graph coloring. The generic form of the BP equations is used, with two modifications. First, since each factor node has only two neighbors in circular coloring, the product in the second equation simplifies. Second, the function $f_a$ that computes the potential of each edge takes into account the circular nature of the problem and allows only pairs of consecutive colors modulo q.\n\nThe first equation calculates the message $\\chi_{s_j}^{j \\rightarrow a}$ from variable node j to factor node a. It is calculated as the product of the potential function $g_j$ and the messages from all other factor nodes $\\partial j \\backslash a$, normalized by the partition function $Z^{j \\rightarrow a}$. The potential function $g_j$ is equal to 1, and the messages from other factor nodes are represented by $\\psi_{s_j}^{b \\rightarrow j}$. \n\nThe second equation calculates the message $\\psi_{s_i}^{a \\rightarrow i}$ from factor node a to variable node i. It is calculated as the sum over all possible colors of the product of the potential function $f_a$ and the messages from all other variable nodes $\\partial a \\backslash i$, normalized by the partition function $Z^{a \\rightarrow i}$. The potential function $f_a$ takes into account the circular nature of the problem and allows only pairs of consecutive colors modulo q. The messages from other variable nodes are represented by $\\chi_{s_j}^{j \\rightarrow a}$. \n\nThe final BP equations are obtained by plugging the expression for $\\psi_{s_i}^{a \\rightarrow i}$ into the first equation for $\\chi_{s_j}^{j \\rightarrow a}$, and simplifying the resulting expression. The final equation for $\\chi_{s_j}^{j \\rightarrow(i j)}$ only depends on the messages from the two variable nodes connected to the factor node, and has the same form as the equation for graph coloring.\n\nIn summary, the BP equations for circular coloring on random regular graphs are obtained by using the generic form of the BP equations, modifying the potential function to take into account the circular nature of the problem, and simplifying the expression for the messages due to the two neighbors of each factor node."

        "answer": "In a cricket match, after the first 10 overs, the team had a run rate of 6.2 runs per over and had scored a total of 62 runs. The remaining overs were 40, and the team needed to score a total of 282 runs to win the match. To calculate the required run rate, we subtracted the runs scored in the first 10 overs from the total runs needed and obtained 220. We then assumed the required run rate to be x and multiplied it by the remaining overs, which gave us 40x. Equating 40x to 220, we obtained x = 220 / 40 = 5.5. Therefore, the required run rate for the team to win the match is 5.5 runs per over."

        "question": "In normal job-hunting, it's acceptable to apply for jobs \"informationally\", to learn about new opportunities before deciding whether the new opportunity is better than your current.\n\nSuppose I'm a published MS-level researcher in industry, but have gotten interested in certain research projects in academia and see PhD student lab openings. I'd like to learn more about the projects to see if the project direction is a good fit for my interests, see if I like the culture of the team, see if I like the location, learn more about the funding situation and expected work-life balance of the lab. All five of these things are unknowns when applying to a normal job, and it's acceptable in industry (I'm in EECS) to interview for several rounds with on-site visits to find answers on both sides before deciding if it's a good fit. If for any reason the applicant declines, it's perfectly acceptable to interview with the same team a few years down the road as projects, willingness to relocate, family situation all change dramatically over the course of one's lifetime.\n\nAs a practicing researcher in the field, I can of course do due diligence and read the relevant papers/ codebases, etc., but interviewing with the faculty and meeting the future team by being accepted to the associated graduate program are necessary to fully evaluate whether the new position is more desirable than the current one.\n\nWould this attitude be seen negatively, both by the potential future advising faculty or the larger admitting institution? Would schools be more reluctant to admit me if I re-apply? For context, I'm in the US and would be applying to top-N schools.\n\nIf this approach is not appropriate for grad-school, how would I go about managing how project/location/team/cultural fit, from my perspective, could change over my lifetime as, e.g., the kids grow up and move out, the field changes and develops. It seems a bit absurd that, because an opportunity or team was not a good fit at some point in my lifetime, it would be closed to me for the rest of a 30 year career, so if this is the case I have trouble understanding the underlying reasoning.",
        "answer": "In my view, it's completely different to apply intending to find a position but not find the right fit than it is to apply \"explorationally\" to gather information without intending to follow through during the current admissions cycle. And I don't think that's unique to grad school/academia, it's rude to waste any interviewer's time.\n\nIn industry, it's more common to be contacted for an interview or to go into an interview where both parties know you aren't on the immediate job market. That's different from abusing someone else's time for practice or whatever else. Yes, you'll find professional articles written that say otherwise. Sure, you might see other people doing it. Rude people do rude things all the time, selfish people coach others to be selfish; that doesn't make them less rude or selfish.\n\nApplying isn't a commitment to take a position, and it would be wrong for someone to take your honest rejection of their offer too personally. However, they have every right next time around to be skeptical of your interest. Offers for grad school positions usually come on a fairly competitive calendar; if someone doesn't accept your offer, their second choice might have already committed elsewhere.\n\nIt seems you aren't quite sure if you want to go the academic route. I'd recommend reaching out to labs to communicate without applying. Let them know, honestly, what your position is. You probably have resources to travel, so visit some potential cities as a tourist and see how you like the vibe on your own. If you're doing research work now that's of academic interest, you may be able to arrange to visit and give a talk like an academic would, which typically comes with opportunities to meet with faculty and current students (and maybe even a honorarium for speaking, or at least a free meal).\n\nAnd know that you aren't that special for having started an industry career first - most people have. A PhD in the US is usually a 5+ year commitment, and it's coming with a likely big pay cut for you. Rather than having negotiating power due to your salary and experience, you are probably in a negotiating hole because you are a higher risk to drop out after experiencing a cost of living crunch than a fresh student who has always lived in shared student housing. You'll be needing to explain why exactly you're a good fit for academia, and you'll have to convince programs that you're committed to them."

        "answer": "When designing labels for FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer), it is important to follow certain rules to ensure accurate and reliable results. One of these rules is to avoid high protein concentrations. This is because at high concentrations, the proteins can interact with each other and form aggregates, which can interfere with the FRET signal. Additionally, high protein concentrations can lead to increased background fluorescence, making it more difficult to detect the FRET signal. Therefore, it is important to optimize the labeling conditions and use the lowest possible protein concentration that still allows for accurate measurements."

        "answer": "The answer states that if \\(f:I\\to J\\) is a differentiable bijection between open intervals \\(I\\) and \\(J\\), and if \\(x\\) is such that \\(f'(x)\\neq 0\\) and \\(y=f(x)\\), then \\((f^{-1})'(y)=\\frac{1}{f'(x)}\\).\n\nIn other words, if we have a differentiable bijection \\(f\\) between open intervals \\(I\\) and \\(J\\), and if we know that \\(f'(x)\\neq 0\\) for some \\(x\\in I\\), then we can find the derivative of the inverse function \\(f^{-1}\\) at \\(y=f(x)\\) as \\((f^{-1})'(y)=\\frac{1}{f'(x)}\\).\n\nThis result is known as the inverse function theorem, and it tells us that the derivative of the inverse function can be expressed in terms of the derivative of the original function. Intuitively, if the original function is changing rapidly at a point, then the inverse function is changing slowly at the corresponding point. The theorem provides a useful tool for finding the derivatives of inverse functions in many applications."

Do I need to manually create a migration for the pivot table? Or how does Laravel know to create the pivot table?\n\nAll I've done so far is add the `belongsToMany` information to the two respective models, i.e.\n\n```\nclass User extends Eloquent \n{\n    public function roles()\n    {\n         return $this->belongsToMany('Role');\n     }\n }\n\n```\n\nHowever, that does not trigger creation of the pivot table.

        "answer": "In addition to all the above answers\n\n* There is no need to have an AI index for a pivot table. Its uniquely defined by its touple (key1,key2).\n* The primary key should be the composition (key1,key2). The benefits are that the touples are unique and all queries are best optimized.\n\nSo here comes a real life example:\n\n```\nSchema::create('bill_user', function (Blueprint $table) {\n    // unsigned is needed for foreign key\n    $table->integer('user_id')->unsigned();\n    $table->integer('bill_id')->unsigned();\n\n    $table->primary(['user_id', 'bill_id']);\n\n    $table->foreign('user_id')\n        ->references('id')->on('users')\n        ->onDelete('cascade');\n\n    $table->foreign(bill_id')\n        ->references('id')->on('bills')\n        ->onDelete('cascade');\n});\n\n```"

        "answer": "Given that 3 pumps take a total of 16 hours, with each day consisting of 8 hours, it can be inferred that each pump takes 16/3 = 5.33 hours to complete the task. Therefore, if only one pump is working, it would take 48 hours (16*3) to complete the task. \n\nTo determine the time required if 15 pumps were contributing to the task, we divide 48 by 15, resulting in 3.2 hours.

This means that the decision boundary will be close to a line parallel to the $x$-axis, as $w_2x_2$ will be close to 0 for any value of $x_2$.\n\nMoreover, we can simplify the logistic regression model to $\\prob(y=1|x_1, x_2, w_1, w_2) = \frac{1}{1+\\exp(-w_1x_1)}$ by setting $w_2$ to 0. This indicates that the classifier outputs 1 or 0 depending on the sign of $x_1$, and thus the decision boundary is $x_1 = 0$, which is a vertical line passing through the origin.

Alors\\(I=\\left]-1,1\\right[\\), \\(I=\\left]-1,1\\right]\\), \\(I=\\left[-1,1\\right[\\), \\(I=\\left[-1,1\\right]\\),",
        "answer": "Nous utilisons encore le crit\u00e8re de d'Alembert pour trouver que \\( r = 1 \\). Nous avons que \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^{2k} \\) et \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^{k}\\) sont toutes les deux des s\u00e9ries divergentes. Cela n'est pas difficile \u00e0 remarquer. Nous avons donc que la premi\u00e8re proposition est vraie."
