Now, consider choosing the second point on the bottom-right segment. The probability for it to be distance at least $0.5$ apart from $A$ is $\\dfrac{0 + 1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ because of linearity of the given probability. (Alternatively, one can set up a coordinate system and use geometric probability.)\nIf the second point $B$ is on the left-bottom segment, then if $A$ is distance $x$ away from the left-bottom vertex, then $B$ must be up to $\\dfrac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{0.25 - x^2}$ away from the left-middle point.

Since $D$ is at a constant distance of $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ from $M$, then $D$ rotates along one-quarter (since $90^\\circ$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of $360^\\circ$) of a circle of radius $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, for a distance of $\\frac{1}{4}\\left( 2\\pi\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi$.\n\nIn the next segment of the roll, $Q$ stays stationary and the square rolls until $P$ touches the table.

This is similar to the second segment, so $D$ rolls through a distance of $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi$.\n\nThrough the next segment of the roll, $N$ stays stationary and the square rolls until $M$ touches the table.  This will be the end of the process as the square will end up in its initial position.  This segment is similar to the first segment so $D$ rolls through a distance of $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the total distance through which the dot travels is  $$\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi+\\frac{1}{4}\\pi+\\frac{1}{4}\\pi+\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi$$or $$\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)\\pi,$$so our final answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$."
